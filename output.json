It is defined  as \nany criminal  activity  which  takes  place  on or over the medium  of computers  or \ninternet  or other technology recognised by the Information Technology Act .  \nCyber crime is the most prevalent crime playing a devastating role in Modern \nIndia. Not only the criminals are causing enormous losses to the society and \nthe government but are also able t o conceal their identity to a great extent. \nThere  are number  of illegal  activities  which  are committed  over the internet  by \ntechnically  skilled  criminals.  Taking a wider interpretation it can be said that, \nCyber  crime  includes any illegal  activity  where  computer  or internet  is either  a \ntool or target  or both.   \nThe term cyber  crime  may be judicially interpreted in some judgments \npassed by courts in India, however it is not defined  in any act or statute  passed  \nby the Indian  Legislature.  Cyber  crime  is an uncontrollable evil having  its base \nin the misuse of growing  dependence  on computers  in modern  life. Usage of \ncomputer and other allied technology in daily life is growing rapidly and has \nbecome an urge which facilitates user convenience. It is a medium w hich is \ninfinite and  immeasurable . Whatsoever  the good  internet  does to us, it has its \ndark sides  too.1 Some  of the newly  emerged  cybercrimes  are cyber -stalking,  \ncyber -terrorism,  e-mail spoofing,  e-mail bombing,  cyber  pornography,  cyber -\ndefamation  etc. Some  conventional  crimes  may also come  under  the category  \nof cybercrimes  if they are committed  through  the medium  of computer  or \nInternet.   \n2. History  and Evolution  of Cybercrime  \nDuring the period of 1950 \u2019s, it would be an astonished feeling for \neveryone who uses palmtops and microchips today, to know that the first \n                                                           \n1 Prof. R.K.Chaubey, \u201cAn Introduction to Cyber Crime and Cyber law\u201d, Kamal Law House, \n2012  \nP a g e  | 25 \n \nsuccessful  computer  was built and the size of the computer  was so big that it \ntakes  the space  of entire  room  and they were  too expensive  to opera te. The \nfunctioning of these  computer  were not understandable to large  number  of \npeople  and only select  people with expertise had direct  access  to such \ncomputers,  and has the knowledge  to operate  them.  For obvious reasons, the \ncomputer technology was extremely expensive and beyond the purchasing \ncapacity of almost the entire population until IBM \u2019s came into being wherein \nit introduc ed its stand -alone  \u201cpersonal  computer\u201d  in 1981  and exposing  many  \nto the rewards  of quick  data access  and manipulation  that, up to that time,  had \nbeen  realized  by few. The Personal  computers  become  cheaper  and become  \nhousehold  item at the start of 21st century in India.  The Internet  was first \nstarted  by the US department  of defence,  after World  War II with the idea to \nhave  a network  which  could  work  in the event  of disaster  or war and securely  \ntransmit  information.  The First Network  was known  as ARPANET,  with the \ndevelopment  of Transmission  Control  Protocol/Internet  Protocol,  World  Wide  \nWeb  and Hypertext  the internet  become  rage all over the world.  With  the \ngrowth  of Internet  the quality  and variety  of information  grew.  However  at \nthat point  nobody  anticipated  the opportunities \u2019 the internet  is going  to provide  \nthe technology  savvy  criminals.  \n In India  the internet  services  started  by the state-owned  Videsh  \nSanchar  Nigam  Limited  in year 1995  and in 1998  the government  has ended  \nthe monopoly  of VSNL  and market  is opened  to private  operators.  At that \npoint,  the internet  users  in India  are 0.1%  of total population,  and now India  \nhas become  the 2nd largest  country  in terms  of internet  users  after china  with \n33.22%  people  using  internet.2  \nThe process  of criminalization  of human  behaviour  judged  to be \nharmful  the public  is typically  one that builds  slowly  in common  law \njurisdictions.  Momentum  gained  through  problem  identification  and pressures  \n                                                           \n2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users (Accessed on \n3rd February, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 26 \n \nexerted  mg special  interest  groups  can easily  span decades  before  undesir able \nactions are classified as \u201c crime \u201d. In some  instances,  this process  is accelerated  \nthrough the occurrence of certain \u201c catalyst  events \u201d that capture  attention  of the \npublic  and the attention  of lawmakers.3 \nThe first recorded  cyber  crime  took place  in the year 1820.  That is not \nsurprising  considering  the fact that the abacus,  which  is thought  to be the \nearliest  form  of a computer,  has been  around  since  3500  B.C. in India,  Japan  \nand China.  The era of modem  computers,  however,  began  with the analytical  \nengine  of Charles  Babbage.  In 1820,  Joseph -Marie  Jacquard,  a textile  \nmanufacturer  in France,  produced  the loom.  This device  allowed  the repetition  \nof a series  of steps  in the weaving  of special  fabrics.  This resulted  in a fear \namongst  Jacquard \u2019s employees  that their traditional  employment  and \nlivelihood  were  being  threatened.  They  committed  acts of sabotage  to \ndiscourage  Jacquard  from  further  use of the new technology.  This is the first \nrecorded  cyber  crime.4 \nIn the case of computer  crime,  legislators  grew  increasingly  attentive  is \nthe 1980s  as businesses  became  more  dependent  upon  computerization  and as \ncatalyst  event  cases  exposed  significant  vulnerabilities  to computer  crime  \nviolations.  Criminals  can now easily  encrypt  information  representing  \nevidence  of their criminal  acts, store  the information  and even  transmit  it with \nlittle fear of detection  by law enforcement.  Due to the extraordinary  impact  of \nthe Internet,  a computer  crime  scene  can now span from  the geographical  \npoint  of the victimization (e.g., the victim \u2019s personal  computer)  to any other  \npoint  on the planet,  further  complicating  criminal  investigative  efforts.  In \neffect,  computer  technology  has dramatically  altered  the criminal  justice  \nterrain  such that enterprising  and opportunistic  criminals  have  consciously  \nturned  to the computer  to commit  their illegal  acts in situations  in which  the \ncomputer  serves  as the instrument  of the crime,  the means  by which  the crime  \n                                                           \n3 Abraham D. Sofaer, Seymour E, .The Transnational Dimension of Cyber Crime Terrorism, \nHoover Institution Press, 2001.  \n4 http://cybercrime.planeti ndia.net/intro.htm (Accessed on 4th February, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 27 \n \nis committed,  as well as in cases in which the victim \u2019s computer,  or computer  \nsystem,  is the target,  or objective,  of the act. And,  as stated  above,  the \npresence  of new computer  technology  aids cyber  criminals  in situations in \nwhich the computer \u2019s role is incidental  to the crime;  situations  in which  the \ncomputer  is used to house  and protect  information  that is evidence  tying  the \noffender  to criminal  acts. A commonality  among  these  types  of crimes  is that \nthe offender,  to a great  degree,  depends  upon  the lack of technological  skills  of \nlaw enforcement  to successfully  commit  the offenses  and escape  undetected.  \nBased  upon  what  empirical  evidence  has been  available  on self-assessed  skills  \nof investigators  in this area,  computer  criminals  would  have  good  reason  to \nfeel some  confidence  in their chances  to evade  detection  of their crimes.5 \nAs we advance towards the 21st century,  it van be observed that the \ntechnological  innovations  have  laid the way for the entire population using \ncomputer technology today, to experience  new and wonderful  conveniences  in \ntheir daily life ranging from how to educated,  shop,  entertain , to availing the  \nunderstanding of the business  strategies and work flow . Our day to-day lives  \nhave  been  forever  changed  thanks  to rapid  advances  made  in the field of \ncomputer  technology.  These  changes  allow  us to communicate  over great  \ndistances  in an instant  and permit  us, almost  effortlessly,  to gather  and \norganize  large  amounts  of information,  tasks  that could,  otherwise,  prove  \nunwieldy  and expensive.  The technological  treasures  that have  improved  the \nquality  of our lives,  however,  can reasonably  be viewed  as a doubled -edged  \nsword.  While  computer  technology  has opened  doors  to enhanced  \nconveniences  for many,  this same  technology  has also opened  new doors  for \ncriminals.  \n3. Definition  of Cyber  Crime   \n                                                           \n5 Stambaugh, H., et. al, Electronic Crime Needs Assessment for State and Local Law \nEnforcement, National Institute of Justice Report, Washington, Dc: U.S. Department of \nJustice, March 2001. Available at : https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/198421.pdf  \n(Accessed at 04th February, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 28 \n \n The Indian Legislature doesn \u2019t provide the exact definition of Cyber \ncrime in any statute, even the Information Technology Act, 2000; which deals \nwith cyber crime doesn \u2019t defined the term of cyber crime. However in general \nthe term cybercrime means any illegal activity which is carried over or with \nthe help of interne t or computers.  \nDr. Debarati  Halder  and Dr. K. Jaishankar  define  cybercrimes  as: \n\u201cOffences  that are committed  against  individuals  or groups  of individuals  with \na criminal  motive  to intentionally  harm  the reputation  of the victim  or cause  \nphysical  or mental  harm,  or loss, to the victim  directly  or indirectly,  using  \nmodern  telecommunication  networks  such as Internet  (Chat  rooms,  emails,  \nnotice  boards  and groups)  and mobile  phones  (SMS/MMS)\u201d6 \nWe do not have  any precise  definition  of cyber  crime;  however  \nfollowing  is the general  definitions  of term cyber  crime:  \nThe oxford  Dictionary  defined  the term cyber  crime  as \u201cCriminal  \nactivities  carried  out by means  of computers  or the Internet.\u201d7 \n\u201cCyber  crime  may be said to be those  species,  of which,  genus  is the \nconventional  crime,  and where  either  the computer  is an object  or subject  of \nthe conduct  constituting  crime\u201d8 \n\u201cCyber  crime  means  any criminal  or other  offence  that is facilitated  by \nor involves  the use of electronic  communications  or information  systems,  \nincluding  any device  or the Internet  or any one or more  of them\u201d9 \nProfessor  S.T. Viswanathan  has given  three  definitions  in his book  The \nIndian  Cyber  Laws  with Cyber  Glossary  is as follows  -  \n1 Any illegal  action  in which  a computer  is the tool or object  of \nthe crime  i.e. any crime,  the means  or purpose  of which  is to influence  the \nfunction  of a computer,   \n                                                           \n6 http://www.ripublication.com/irph/ijict_spl/ijictv4n3spl_06.pdf (Accessed on 4th January, \n2016)  \n7 http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cybercrime (Acc essed on 4th January, \n2016)  \n8 http://www.naavi.org/pati/pati_cybercrimes_dec03.htm (Accessed on 4th January, 2016)  \n9 http://cybercrime.org.za/definition (Accessed on 4th January, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 29 \n \n2 Any incident  associated  with computer  technology  in which  a \nvictim  suffered  or could  have  suffered  loss and a perpetrator,  by intention,  \nmade  or could  have  made  a gain,   \n3 Computer  abuse  is considered  as any illegal,  unethical  or \nunauthorized  behavior  relating  to the automatic  processing  and transmission  of \ndata.10   \n4. Nature  and Scope  of Cyber  Crime   \nCrime is a socially correlated phenomenon. No matter how much we \ntry, we cannot experience a society without cybercrime. In actual sense, when \nwe are not yet able to control the crime rate to the desirable minimum in the \nreal world, how would it be possible to curb the same in the virtual world, as \nthe same is c omparatively more unreal, everlasting and legally less \ncontrollable. However with the time, nature and scope and definition of crime \nchanges in a given society. Crimeless society is a myth and crime cannot be \nsegregated from a society. Thus the nature of t he crime depends upon the \nnature of a society.  \nComplexity of the society determines the complexity of the crime that \nevolves \u2019 around it.  To understand the crime in a society, it is essential and \ncrucial to verify all the factors which influence and contribute to the crime. \nThe socio - economic and political structure of the society needs to understand \nthe crime and the recourse that may curb the same. The preventive and \ncorrective measures adopted by the machinery to control the crime and \ndelinquent behaviour in the society are also taken into consideration while \nstudying the nature and scope of a crime.  \nThe advancement of the te chnology has produced new socio -economic \nand political problem in the society and instead of helping the state in \ncontrolling the problem it has created new complex situation which is difficult \nto understand  and even more difficult to apply current law to  face the \n                                                           \n10 S.T. Viswanathan, The Indian Cyber Laws with Cyber Glossary , 2001, p.  81.  \nP a g e  | 30 \n \nsituation. The state machinery is not equipped with enough sources and \nknowledge to handle the modern crime.  \nComputers have transformed the modern society beyond expectations \nin last three to  four decades. It has made life not only convenient but  has also \nimmensely helped different sections of the world come closer socially, \neconomically and culturally. The Computer technology has made it possible to \nhave access to all corners of the world while sitting in a room. Modern \ntechnology has put an end to the barriers of time and space. However , unlikely \nwith the remarkable merits of having computers today, due to this the \njurisdictional issue has been created in legal system.  \nJurisdiction is one aspect which is very difficult to determine in \ntransnatio nal transaction over the internet. There was unmanageable ambiguity \nwhen courts were subjected to questions pertaining to jurisdiction law and \nwere unable to decide the proper forum to entertain cases involving cyber \ncrime as the cyberspace or virtual worl d is borderless if we compare it with \nphysical world and that is why it is very difficult to control cybercrime. \nThrough the local machinery we are not able to tackle the problem related \nwith cyber crime because our machinery is not compatible to deal with  \ntransnational crimes. The law applicable to the territory is not advanced \nenough to regulate the cyber crime as their nature is far different from the \nexisting crime.  \nThus, the global dimension of cyber crime is made it difficult to handle \nand dealt with . The evolution of internet technology has given us so many \nadvantages to deal with future problems and grow with rapid rate but also it \nhas provided the scope for criminals to commit their crime with least chance \nof detection. The cyberspace has proved a boon to the deviant behaviour in the \nsociety. The concept of cyber crime has gained speed and we are facing great \nthreat of its impact on world society. The human society is become vulnerable \nto cyber crime due to more and more dependence on technology.  \nP a g e  | 31 \n \nCyber crime becomes a global phenomenon and hence the nationwide \ngeneralization of crime cannot workable in present scenario. Our \nunderstanding and regulation of cyber crime cannot be national but has to be \ninternational. We have to enact new laws and prepa re preventive and \ndefensive mechanism globally, only then we can able to protect our society \nfrom this evil called \u2018Cyber Crime \u2019.  \nTherefore, the threat of cyber terrorism throws serious challenge to \nworld and its agencies. The terrorist organizations usin g technology to spread \nhatred among people and using it to recruit militants and train them using \nteaching tools. They are also launching websites which show them how to use \nweapons make bombs etc.  \n4.1 Doctrine  of Mens  Rea & Actus  Reus  in Cyber  Crime  \nAs far as Traditional Crime is concerned Mens  Rea and Actus  Reus  are \nthe two most important elements to crime. Actus Reus means \u201c Such  result  of \nhuman  conduct  as the law seeks  to prevent\u201d11. There must be commission or \nomission to constitute a crime. As far as mens rea is concerned, it means \u201c A \nguilty  state  of mind\u201d12.  The mental element forms the other important \ningredient of crime. The act remains the same while the state of mind makes \nthe act \u2018reus\u2019 and hence an offence.  Almost all the crime requires proof o f \nmental element of some sort.13 As far cyber crime goes it is very difficult to \ndetermine the mens rea in cybercrimes.  \nIn Cyber crimes, one should see what the state of mind of hacker was \nand that the hacker knew that the access was unauthorised. Thus, a \u201cParticular \nComputer\u201d needs not to be intended by the hacker, it is enough if the \nunauthorised access was to \u201cany comput er\u201d. Awareness on the part of the \nhacker becomes easier to prove where he is an outsider and has no authority to \n                                                           \n11 J.W.C. Turner, Kenney\u2019s Outlines of criminal law  (19th Edition University Press, Cambridge \n1966) 17.  also at Talat Fatima, Cyber Crime  (1st Edition, Eastern Book Company, Lucknow \n2011 ) p. 64 -68 \n12 R.C. Nigam, \u201c Law of Crimes in India \u201d, Principals of  criminal Law , Vol 1, (Asia Publishing \nHouse, 1965) 6.   \n13 Talat Fatima, Cyber Crime  (1st Edition, Eastern Book Company, Lucknow 2011 ) p. 64 -68 \nP a g e  | 32 \n \naccess. But where hacker is already has limited authority as ion the case of the \nemployee of a company, it becomes difficult establish that he exceeded his \nlimits and was even aware of the fact that he is exceeding it.  \nActus Reus in cybercrimes has become a challenge as the entire act is \ncommitted in intangible surroundings. The perpetrator may leave some \nfootmarks in the machine itself though it  becomes a herculean task for the law \nenforcement machinery to prove it in the courts, as it is required to be in \nphysical form or atleast in such a form where it becomes admissible in \nevidence.14    \n5. Characteristics  of Cyber  Crime  \nThe Concept of cyber cr ime is very different from the traditional \ncrime. Also due to the growth of Internet Technology, this crime has gained \nserious and unfettered attention as compared to the traditional crime. So it is \nnecessary to examine the peculiar characteristics of cybe r crime.  \n 1. People  with specialized knowledge  \u2013 Cyber crimes can only be \ncommitted through the technology, thus to commit this kind of crime one has \nto be very skilled in internet and computers and internet to commit such a \ncrime. The people who have comm itted cyber crime are well educated and \nhave deep understanding of the usability of internet, and that \u2019s made work of \npolice machinery very difficult to tackle the perpetrators of cyber crime.  \n2. Geographical  challenges \u2013 In cyberspace the geographical \nboundaries reduced to zero. A cyber criminal in no time sitting in any part of \nthe world commit crime in other corner of world. For example a hacker sitting \nin India hack in the system placed in United States.  \n3. Virtual World \u2013The act of cyber crime takes  place in the cyber \nspace and the criminal who is committing this act is physically outside the \ncyber space. Every activity of the criminal while committing that crime is \ndone over the virtual world.  \n                                                           \n14 Ibid \nP a g e  | 33 \n \n4. Collection of Evidence  - It is very difficult  to collect  evidence  of \ncyber  crime  and prove  them  in court  of law due to the nature of cyber crime. \nThe criminal in cyber crime invoke jurisdiction of several countries while \ncommitting the cyber crime and at the same time he is sitting some place safe \nwhere he is not traceable.  \n5. Magnitude of crime unimaginable - The cyber crime has the \npotential of causing injury and loss of life to an extent which cannot be \nimagined. The offences like cyber terrorism, cyber pornography etc has wide \nreach and it can destroy the websites, steal data of the companies in no time.  \n6.  Classification  of Cyber  Crime   \nThe researcher  in this chapter  examines  the acts wherein  computer  or \ntechnology  is tool for an unlawful  act. The kind of activities  usually  involves  a \nmodification  of conventional  crime  by using  informational  technology.  Here  is \nthe list of prevalent  cyber  crimes,  some  of them  widely  spread  and some  are \nnot prevalent  on larger  scale.  The cyber  crimes  are discussed  below - \n6.1 Cyber  Pornography  \nThe word  \u2018Pornography \u2019 derived  from  Greek  words  \u2018Porne \u2019 and \n\u2018Graphein \u2019 means  writing  about  prostitutes,  or referred  to any work  of art or \nliterature  dealing  with sex and sexual  themes.  Defining  the term pornography  \nis very difficult  and it does not have  any specific  definition  in the eyes of law \nas every  country  has their own customs  and tradition.  The act of pornography  \nin some  countries  is legal  but in some  it is illegal  and punishable.     \nCyber  pornography  is in simple  words  defined  as the act of using  \ncyberspace  to create,  display,  distribute,  import,  or publish  pornography  or \nobscene  materials.  With  the advent  of cyberspace,  traditional  pornographic  \ncontent  has now been  largely  replaced  by online/digital  pornographic  \ncontent.15 Pornography  has no legal  or consistent  definition.  The definition  of \n                                                           \n15 http://blog.ipleaders.in/cyber -pornography -law-in-india -the-grey-law-decoded/ (Accessed \non 5th February, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 34 \n \npornography  depends  how the society,  norms  and their values  are reacting  to \nthe pornographic  content.   \nThe reason  why we do not have  a clear  definition  as far as \npornography  is concerned  is that we do not have  uniform  standard  culture  and \nethics  in the world  nor do we have  uniform  laws which  defines  the \npornography.  The concept  of obscenity  and pornography  varies  from  country  \nto country  and time to time.  The terms  obscenity  and pornography  are \ndifferent  but related  to each other.  The same  material  which  was banned  in \nsome  countries  may be allowed  in some.  The Indian  law doesn \u2019t define  the \nterm pornography  and not deal with this term.   \nIn the modern  world  sex sells and sells extremely  well,  and the fact is \nthat present  pornography  industry  is larger  than any other  company  or \ncombination  of companies  in the world.  The advent  of internet  in the world  \nhas started  the new chapter  in the porn industry.  The porn industry  find perfect  \nplace  in internet  to spread  pornographic  material  all over the world.  According  \nto the internet  filter  review  report  of 2010,  there  are 4.2 million  websites  \noffering  porn content  to the world.  68 million  daily  search  engine  requests  are \nmade  and 72 million  worldwide  user visit adult  sites per month.  42.7 percent  \nof total users  who use internet  watch  pornographic  material  over the internet.16 \nIn the initial  years  or we can say before  internet  available  to the public,  \nDVD \u2019s and Videotapes  are the popular  medium  of distributing  pornography.  \nBut after that internet  is available  to general  public  and it becomes  the most  \npopular  medium  to make  pornography  available  to user in the comfort  of their \nhomes.  An individual  who due to the peer pressure  or shame  doesn \u2019t have  \naccess  to the pornographic  material , nowadays  easily  watch  picture  or video  \non the internet.  The rise of pornography  websites  offering  photos,  video  clips  \nand streaming  media  including  live web cam access  allowed  greater  access  of \n                                                           \n16 http://internet -filter -review.toptenreviews.com/internet -pornography -statistics.html \n(Accessed on 6th February, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 35 \n \npornography.  Information  technology  has made  it easier  to create  and \ndistribute  pornographic  materials  through  the internet;  such as material  can be \ntransmitted  all over the world  in a matter  of seconds,  the geographical  \nrestrictions  which  prevented  to a certain  extent,  foreign  publication  to enter  \nlocal  territories  have  disappeared.17  \n6.1.1 Test of  Obscenity  and Pornography  \nTo understand  the gravity  and effect  of pornography  and obscenity  on \nsociety,  we need  to understand  these  terms  in their widest  possible  amplitude.  \nThe Word  Pornography  has not been  defined  legally  in any part of the world.  \nThe basic  reason  behind  this is very simple;  neither  we do have  any uniform  \nstandard  of moral  cultural,  values  and ethics  and nor we have  any uniform  \nstandard  of law. \nThe term obscene  means  relating  to materials  that can be regulated  or \ncriminalized  because  their depiction  of nudity,  sex, or excretion  is patently  \noffensive  and without  artistic  or scientific  value.18 \nThe test of obscenity  was first laid down  in the case of Regina  V. \nHicklin19 as the tendency  \u201cto deprave  and corrupt  those  whose  minds  are open  \nto such influences  and into whose  hands  a publication of this sort may fall\u201d, \nand it was understood that this test would apply only to the isolated passage of \nthe work.  \nIn Miller  v. California20, the Supreme Court of United States in \nlandmark judgment gave the  basic guidelines and three point tests to \ndetermine obscenity in the work i.e.  \n                                                           \n17 Gorman, L. and Maclean, D.

That the work  depicts  or describes,  in an offensive  way,  sexual  \nconduct  or excretory  functions,  as specifically  defined  by applicable  state law \nor applicable law.  \n3. W hether  the work,  taken  as a whole,  lacks  serious  literary,  artistic,  \npolitical,  or scientific  value.  \nBefore the miller \u2019s (supra) case,  in Roth v. United States21 The \nSupreme Court of United States in landmark case held that \u201c obscene material \nwas not protected by the First Amendment and could be regulated by the \nStates rather than by a singular, Federal sta ndard  and also  a new judicial \nstandard for defining obscenity that invoked the average person \u2019s application \nof contemporary community standards to judge whether or not the dominant \ntheme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest .\u201d The \nSupreme further held that \u201c to decide obscenity derived we need to consider  the \nfollowing five -part structure:  \n(1) The perspective of evaluation was that of an ordinary, reasonable \nperson .  \n(2) Community  standards of acceptability were to be used to measure  \nobscenity . \n(3) Obscenity law will only apply to the works whose theme is in \nquestion.  \n(4) A work, in order to be evaluated for obscenity, had to be taken in \nits entirety . \n(5) An obscene work was one that aimed to excited individuals \u2019 \nprurient interest. \u201d \n                                                           \n21 354 U S 476 (1957)  \nP a g e  | 37 \n \nHowever, in India miller test was not adopted by the Supreme Court, \ninstead it has adopted the Hicklin \u2019s Test in leading case of Ranjeet D. Udeshi \nv. State of Maharashtra22; the Supreme Court has decided many issues \npertaining to the obscenity. The apex court doesn \u2019t consider obscenity a vague \nconcept but a word which is well -unders tood even if persons differ in  their \nattitude to what is obscene and what is not.  The apex court has stated that \u201c In \njudging a work, stress should not be laid upon a word here and a word there, \nor a passage here and a passage there. Though the work as a whole must be \nconsidered, the obscene matter must be considered by itself and separately to \nfind out whether it is so gross and its obscenity so decided that it is likely to \ndeprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to influences of this sort. In \nthis connection the interests of contemporary society and particularly the \ninfluence of the impugned book on it must not be overlooked. Where, \nobscenity and art are mixed, art must s o preponderate as to throw the \nobscenity into a shadow or the obscenity so trivial and insignificant that it can \nhave no effect and may be overlooked. It is necessary that a balanc e should be \nmaintained between \u201c freedom  of speech and expression\u201d and \u201c publi c decency \nor morality\u201d ; but when the latter is substantially transgressed the former must \ngive way. \u201d \nThe court however, sounded a note of caution that treating with sex \nand nudity in art and literature cannot be regarded as evidence of obscenity \nwithout so mething more. In the words of court \u201c It is not necessary that the \nangels and saints of Michelangelo should be made to wear breeches before \nthey can be viewed. If the rigid test of  treating with sex as the minimum \ningredient were accepted hardly any writer of fiction today would escape the \nfate Lawrence had in his days. Half the book -shops would close and the other \nhalf would deal in nothing but moral and religious books .\u201d \n                                                           \n22 AIR 1965 SC 881  \nP a g e  | 38 \n \nIn this case the Supreme Court  has decided that Hicklin \u2019s test cannot  \nbe discarded , and said \u201c It makes the court the judge of obscenity in relation to \nan impugned book etc. and lays emphasis on the potentiality of the impugned \nobject to deprave and cor rupt by immoral influences. It w ill always remain a \nquestion to decide in each case and it  does not compel an adverse decision in \nall cases. \u201d \nIn Samresh Bose v. Amal Mitra,23 the Supreme Court has held that \u201c A \nvulgar writing is not necessarily obscene. Vulgarity arouses a feeling of \ndisgust and revulsion and also boredom but does not have the effect of \ndepraving, debasing and corrupting the morals of any reader of the novels, \nwhereas obscenity has the tendency to deprave and corrupt those whose minds \nare open to such immoral influences \u201d. In this case the court differentiated \nbetween vulgarity a nd obscenity and further held that while judging the \nquestion of obscenity \u201c the Judge should ... place himself in the position of a \nreader of every age group in whose hands the book is likely to fall and should \ntry to appreciate what kind of possible influ ence the book is likely to have in \nthe minds of the readers \u201d. \nIn India, the Indian Penal Code, 186024 deal with the issue of \nobscenity. However with the evolution of internet technology, obscenity and \npornography takes electronic form and it becomes impossi ble to convict the \nperpetrator under Indian penal Code, 1860(supra). To deal with this new \ntechnology, the government of India has enacted Information Technology Act \n200025. Section 67 of Inf ormation Technology Act, 2000; deal with obscenity \nand pornographi c content on internet.  Section 67 of the IT Act provides:  \n\u201cWhoever publishes or transmits or causes to be published in the \nelectronic form, any material which is lascivious or appeals to the prurient \ninterest or if its effect is such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who \n                                                           \n23 AIR 1986 SC 967  \n24 Act 45 of 1860  \n25 Act No 21 of 2000 . \nP a g e  | 39 \n \nare likely, having regard to all r elevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the \nmatter contained or embodied in it, shall be punished on first conviction with \nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two three \nyears and with fine which may extend to five lakh rup ees and in the event of a \nsecond or subsequent conviction with imprisonment of either description for a \nterm which may extend to five years and also with fine which may extend to \nten lakh rupees.\u201d26 \nThe Section 67 of IT Act 2000 is comparable to Section 292  of Indian \nPenal Code, 1860. In Ranjit D. Udeshi v. State of Maharashtra27 held that \nunlike other provision which have words like \u201cknowingly\u201d or \u201cnegligently\u201d \nand thus make mens rea a condition precedent to establish the guilt. Section \n292 does not make kno wledge of obscenity an ingredient of the offence. The \nprosecution does not prove something which the law does not burden it with. \nThe difficulty of obtaining legal evidence of the offender \u2019s knowledge of the \nobscenity of the book, etc. has made the liabili ty strict. The absence of such \nknowledge may be taken in mitigation but does not take the case out of the \nprovision. If we apply the Ranjit D. Udeshi case judgment  (supra ) to Section \n67 of IT Act, 2000, it can be concluded that mere publication and transmi ssion \nof obscene material is an offence notwithstanding the mental state of offender. \nHowever, this cannot be a blanket rule applicable to all and sundry.28 \n6.1.2 Child Pornography  a menance in modern world  \nThe children especially adolescents are in modern  world want to \nexplore everything on information highway. The children in today \u2019s \ngeneration have access to internet and computer \u2019s at home, the internet and \ncomputer are part of their studies.

The parents don \u2019t have \ntoo much control over the children and the children are busy exploring the \ninternet and other medium to fulfill their wi shes through the on -line access. \nSex\u2013offenders exploit these conditions and fulfil the need of children. The \nchild at this tender age doesn \u2019t understand and recognise the potential danger \nof these contacts. The internet is highly used by the abusers to abuse children \nsexually worldwide. The children in India become viable victim to the cyber \ncrime, as internet becomes the household item in India. The children are \nbecoming victims to the aggression of pedophiles.  \nIn the physical world parents know the dan gers, so they warn their \nchildren about the danger and tell me how to avoid or face the problems by \nfacing simple guidelines. But as far as cyber crime or crime related to internet \nis concerned the parents themselves doesn \u2019t know about the problems or \ndang er posed by various service offered over the internet. The pedophiles take \nadvantage of these things and lure children and win their confidence and then \nexploit them because parents or teachers doesn \u2019t tell them about what is wrong \nor right over the intern et.  \nThe Information Technology Act, 2000 doesn \u2019t contain any specific \nprovision related to child pornography  but later a new section 67B29 has been \ninserted in Information Technology Amendment Act 200830. This section \nprovides that: \u201c Whoever, - (a) publishes  or transmits or causes to be published \nor transmitted material in any electronic form which depicts children engaged \nin sexually explicit act or conduct or (b) creates text or digital images, \ncollects, seeks, browses, downloads, advertises, promotes, exch anges or \ndistributes material in any electronic form depicting children in obscene or \nindecent or sexually explicit manner or (c) cultivates, entices or induces \nchildren to online relationship with one or more children for and on sexually \nexplicit act or i n a manner that may offend a reasonable adult on the computer \n                                                           \n29 Information Technology Act, 2000 , S. 67B  \n30 Information Technology Amendment Act 2008 , Act 10of 2009   \nP a g e  | 41 \n \nresource or (d) facilitates abusing children online or (e) records in any \nelectronic form own abuse or that of others pertaining to sexually explicit act \nwith children,  shall be punished on first conviction with imprisonment of \neither description for a term which may extend to five years and with a fine \nwhich may extend to ten lakh rupees and in the event of second or subsequent \nconviction with imprisonment of either desc ription for a term which may \nextend to seven years and also with fine which may extend to ten lakh rupees:  \nProvided that the provisions of section 67, section 67A and this section \ndoes not extend to any book, pamphlet, paper, writing, drawing, painting, \nrepresentation or figure in electronic form - (i) The publication of which is \nproved to be justified as being for the public good on the ground that such \nbook, pamphlet, paper writing, drawing, painting, representation or figure is \nin the interest of science , literature, art or learning or other objects of general \nconcern; or (ii) which is kept or used for bonafide heritage or religious \npurposes  \nExplanation: For the purposes of this section, \"children\" means a \nperson who has not completed the age of 18 years .\u201d31 \nRecently Lt. Col. Jagmohan Balbir Singh was arrested by the Cyber \nCell of the Crime Branch police on the charge of uploading sexually explicit \nimages and clips of children on child pornography websites.  Lt. Col.

It was the German police who first spotted \nthe activity from Mumbai on a server located in the United States. They sent a \nreport to the Interpol, which in turn forwarded it to the CBI Delhi, and \nsubsequently to the Mumbai Crime Branch.  The Cyber Cell tracked the server \nactivity to the Internet Protocol (IP) address of Lt.

However freedom of speech and \nexpression is restricted by section 292 and 499 of Indian Penal Code 1860. It \nmeans that one can \u2019t while exercising their basic right of free dom of speech \nand expression defame anyone and prohibits expression through obscene \nmaterial or publication and distribution of obscene material.  \nThe Fundamental right of freedom and speech is not absolute and \nreasonable restriction are imposed by article  19(2) of Indian constitution \nwhich says that reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred \nunder article 19(1) in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the \nsecurity of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, \ndecency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamati on or \nincitement to an offence.33  \nIn Maqbool Fida Husain v Raj Kumar Pandey34 the fact of the case is \nthat famous painter MF Husain painted an art work of a nude lady in grief \nwithout giving it any title. The untitled painting was sold to a private collector \nin 2004. In 2006 it was included as part of an online charity auction for \nvictims of the Kashmir earthquake under the n ame \u2018Bharat Mata. \u2019 Husain had \nno role or involvement in this auction. There were large -scale protests against \nthe painting, which appeared in an advertisement for the auction. There  were \nmultiple complaints filed under section 292, 29 4, 298 of the Indian P enal \n                                                           \n32 http://www. thehindu.com/todays -paper/army -officer -held-for-child -\npornography/article763433.ece  (Accessed on 6th February, 2016)  \n33 The Constitution of India, Art 19(1) and (2)  \n34 Maqbool Fida Husain v Raj Kumar Pandey , Delhi High Court Crl. Revision Petition No. \n114/2007  \nP a g e  | 43 \n \nCode, 1860 . The question was that whether portrayal of the nude lady in the \npainting as \u201cBharat Mata\u201d should be considered as obscene under section 292 \nof IPC. The Court held that \u201c \u2026the aesthetic touch to the painting dwarfs the \nso-called obscenity in  the form of nudity and renders it so picayune and \ninsignificant that the nudity in the painting can easily be overlooked.\u201d The \nnude woman was not shown in any peculiar kind of posture, nor was her \nsurroundings painted so as to arouse sexual feelings or lu st. The placement of \nthe Ashoka Chakra was also not on any particular part of the body of the \nwoman that could be deemed to show disrespect to the national emblem.  \nThe Court pointed out that \u201c...the literature of India, both religious and \nsecular, is full of sexual allusions, sexual symbolisms and passages of such \nfrank eroticism the likes of which are not to be found elsewhere in world \nliterature.\u201d It went on to state that \u201cWhile an artist should have creative \nfreedom, he is not free to do anything he want s. The line which needs to be \ndrawn is between art as an expression of beauty and art as an expression of an \nill mind intoxicated with a vulgar manifestation of counter -culture where the \nlatter needs to be kept away from a civilian society.\u201d The Court also  said, \n\u201cThere should be freedom for the thought we hate. Freedom of speech has no \nmeaning if there is no freedom after speech. The reality of democracy is to be \nmeasured by the extent of freedom and accommodation it extends.\u201d35 \nIn K.A. Abbas v. Union of India ,36 the Chief Justice of Su preme Court \nM. Hidayatullah held regarding film censorship that \u201cour freedom of speech \nand expression is not absolute rather limited by reasonable restrictions under \nArt. 19 (2) in the interest of general public to maintain p ublic decency and \nmorality. Therefore, film censorship has full jurisdiction in the field of \ncinematograph film to prevent and control obscenity and pornography. \u201d  \n                                                           \n35 http://indiatogether.org/uploads/document/document_upload/2141/blawobscenity.pdf \n(Accessed on 7th February, 2016)  \n36 (1970) 2 SCC 780   \nP a g e  | 44 \n \nIn Raj Kapoor and Others v State and Others37, The Supreme court \nwhile deciding whether the movie, \u201cSatyam Shivam Sundaram,\u201d was obscene \nand indecent  or not  has said that \u201c While a certificate issued by the Censor \nBoard is of relevance, it does not preclude the court from deciding if a film is \nobscene or not. \u201d \nJustice Krishna Iyer further stated that \u201c An act of recognition of moral \nworthiness by a statutory agency is not opinion evidence but an instance or \ntransaction where the fact in issue has been asserted, recognized or affirmed. \nThe Court will examine the film and judge whether its public pol icy, in the \ngiven time and clime, so breaches public morals or depraves basic decency as \nto offend the penal provisions. Yet, especially when a special statute (the \nCinematograph Act) has set special standards for films for public consumption \nand created a  special Board to screen and censor from the angle of public \nmorals and the like, with its verdicts being subject to higher review, inexpert \ncriminal courts must be cautious to \u201crush in\u201d and must indeed \u201cfear to tread\u201d \nlest the judicial process become a pu blic footpath for any highwayman \nwearing a moral mask holding up a film -maker who has traveled the expensive \nand perilous journey to the exhibition of his \u201ccertificated\u201d picture. Iyer went \non to state, \u201cArt, morals and laws, aesthetics are sensitive subjec ts where \njurisprudence meets other social sciences and never goes alone to bark and \nbite because state -made strait -jacket is inhibitive prescription for a free \ncountry unless enlightened society actively participates in the administration \nof justice to aes thetics.\u201d He observed, \u201cThe world \u2019s greatest paintings, \nsculptures, songs, and dances, India \u2019s lustrous heritage, the Konarks and \nKhajurahos, lofty epics, luscious in patches, may be asphyxiated by law, if \nprudes and prigs and state moralists prescribe par adigms and prescribe \nheterodoxies.\u201d38 \n                                                           \n37 AIR 1980 SC 258  \n38 http://indiatogether.org/uploads/document/document_upload/2141/blawobscenity.pdf \n(Accessed on 7th February, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 45 \n \nThe Indecent Representation of Woman Act, 198639 also related to \npornography and obscenity as section 3 and 4 of the act has specifically \nprohibited the indecent representation of woman through advertisement or in \npublication , writing, paintings, and figure or in any other manner and or \nmatters connecte d therewith or incident thereto.  Every website on internet \nconstitutes the indecent representation of woman would fall in the ambit of \nthese sections.   \nIn Jayesh S. Thakkar v. State of Maharashtra,40 the petitioners wrote a \nletter to the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court, about pornographic \nwebsites on the internet. The letter was treated as suo motu  writ petition. The \nBombay High Court passed an order to appoint a committee to suggest and \nrecomme nd ways of preventive and controlling measure and means to protect \nchildren from access to pornographic and obscene material on the internet. \nThe Committee upon identifying key issu es made recommendations on cyber \ncafes that asking Cyber Caf\u00e9s to maintain proper logs and registers of persons \nentering and using their facilities was feasible and desirable. The Cyber Caf\u00e9 \noperators to keep physical records with addresses, checked against Photo \nIdentity cards, of persons who use their machines. Regular users ca n be given \nfree \u2018membership \u2019 to obviate the need for re -entering details on each occasion.  \nThat minor ought to be restricted to using machines that are not behind \npartitions or in cubicles and, preferably, are loaded w ith suitable checking \nsoftware. This, the Committee felt, would serve both as a check and as a \ndeterrent.  The committee placed a special emphasis on lack of technical \nknowledge in police and recommends special training of cyber cops.

Cyber  Stalking  \nStalking in general means behaviour of harassing or threatening the \nother person. Cyber Stalking is an extension of physical form of stalking, \nwhich is committed over the online medium with the use of information \nTechnology. In cyber stalking the internet, e -mail, chat rooms etc. are used to \nstalk another person.  \nThe Wikipedia defines cyber stalking, where the Internet or other \nelectronic means to stalk or harass an individual, a group o f individuals, or an \norganization. It include the making of false accusations or statements of fact \n(as in defamation ), monitoring, making threats, identity theft, damage to data \nor equipme nt, the solicitation of minors for sex, or gathering information th at \nmay be use d to harass.50 \nStalking is a continuous process, consisting of a series of actions, each \nof which may be entirely legal in itself.  The definition of Cyber stalking is not \nuniversal ly acceptable as it varies place to place. According to Professo r \nLamber Royakkers -   \n\u201cCyber stalking  is the repeatedly harassing or threatening of an \nindividual via the internet or other electronic means of communication.  A \ncyber stalker  is someone with amorous and/or sexual motives who constantly \nharasses someone else electronically: via the bulletin board, chats box , e-\nmail, spam, fax, buzzer or voice -mail. Stalking generally involves the constant \nharassment or threatening of someone el se: following a person, appearing at \nsomeone \u2019s house or workplace, making harassing phone calls, leaving written \nmessages or objects, or vandalizing someone \u2019s property. Because the stalking \n                                                           \n49 http://www.thehindu.com/todays -paper/tp -national/prevent -access -to-child -pornography -\ncentre -told/article8287151.ece (Accessed on 28th February , 2016)  \n50 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberstalking (Accessed on 10 the February, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 51 \n \nactivities are so diverse and have to be seen in their connection it is difficult to \ngive a precise description of stalking .\u201d 51 \nCyber stalking doesn\u2019t not involve any physical contact yet stalking \nthrough the internet has found favour among the offenders for certain \nadvantages available like, ease of communication access  to personal \ninformation and anonymity.52 \nAs far as cyber stalking is concerned, the offender has the advantage \nthat he can sit anywhere in the world and harass the victim by posting certain \nderogatory comment or post comments on common discussion boards or  put \nthe mobile number of the victim and his email address on certain social sites \nwhich prompt the other users to send massages or phone calls to the victim in \nmisconceived notion.  The internet has wide reach, the way we communicate \nonline, the personal d ata of individual and other information is easily accessed \nby the offenders through the internet medium, and this makes the individual \nvulnerable to the offence such as cyber stalking.  \nToday internet become the integral part of each other life be it personal \nor professional life. The ease of communication in today \u2019s world made it \neasier for the offenders or person who seeks to take revenge may use this \nmedium to malign the victim by threatening and harassing by sending \noffensive mails.  The fact that cyber stalking does not involve physical contact \nmay create the misperception that it is more benign than physical stalking. \nThis is not necessarily true. As the Internet becomes an ever more integral part \nof our personal and professional liv es, stalkers can take advantage of the ease \nof communications as well as increased access to personal information. \nWhereas a potential stalker may be unwilling or unable to confront a victim in \nperson or on the telephone, he or she may have little hesitati on sending \nharassing or threatening electronic communications to a victim. As with \n                                                           \n51 http://www.sociosite.org/cyberstalking_en.php (Accessed on 10Th February, 2016)  \n52 S. K. Verma, Raman Mittal, Legal Dimension of Cyberspace , Indian Law Institute, Ne w \nDelhi.  \nP a g e  | 52 \n \nphysical stalking, online harassment and threats may be a prelude to a more \nserious behaviour, including physical violence.53 \nStalking has become a problem to women and child ren on a larger part \nin comparison to men. Women are threatened, vandalized, assaulted when it \ncomes to real world but the same things happen when cyber stalking takes \nplace. Obscenity also adds up with the, threatens and harassment. No doubt \nmen also beco me the prey of the same but its lower when it comes to females. \nChildren also undergo the same trauma by adult predators and pedophiles. The \nvictim is normally a person who is less thorough regarding internet services \nand its applications. The stalker is g enerally a person who is a paranoid with \nno self -esteem. But the traits differ from one stalker to another. Some harass to \nseek revenge or some do so for their own pleasure. While some just to do it for \nplaying a mischief.54 \nThere are three ways in which cy ber stalking is conducted i.e.  \n1. stalking  by E-mail - where the offender directly sends e -mail to the \nvictim to threaten her or to harass her. It is the most common form of stalking \nin the modern world. The most common is sending hate, obscene, \npornograp hic material and threatening mail to the victim.  \n2. Stalking  through Internet  \u2013 this is global form of cyber stalking. In \nthis the offender doesn \u2019t invade the private space of the victim but harasses \nher through the global medium publically. The offender through the internet \nmedium post the phone numbers and email address of the victim on porn sites \nand put morphed photos of the victim on cyber spac e and threaten them. This \nis the serious nature of cyber stalking where the stalker chases  all the activity \nof victim on the net and posted false information about her on the websites.  \n                                                           \n53 https://www.astrealegal.com/internet -harassment -cyber -stalking -cyber -harassment -and-\ncyber/ (Accessed on 11th February, 2016)  \n54 Verma Amita, \u2018 Cyber Crimes & Law \u2019, Central Law Publication, p -157-158 also available at  \nhttp://www.legalindia.com/cyber -stalking -the-impact -of-its-legislative -provisions -in-india/ \n(Accessed on 11th February, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 53 \n \n3. Stalking  through Computer  - In this form the offender is \ntechnocrat and he can take control of the computer of the victim as soon as the \ncomputer starts operating.  In this the stalker gets control of the victims \ncomputer address and gets control over it. This form of cyber stalking req uires \nhigh degree of computer knowledge  to get access to the targets computer and \nthe option available to the victim is to disconnect the computer and abandon \nthe current internet address.  \nThe term stalking is not new to the world, in the physical space i t \nexisted for many centuries. The stalking in the physical world is done by the \nformer friends, employees, or the person who wants to force his will over the \ntarget  are the examples of stalkers. But after the advent of cyberspace, the \nreach of the stalker is widened, he can reach to any part of the world and \nthreaten and harass the target. It is not necessary now to disclose his identity, \nmost of the stalkers are the dejected lover \u2019s, ex -boyfriends, colleagues, who \nfailed to satisfy their desire and wants t o harass the victim. Most stalkers are \nman and most victims are women. The common reason behind the cyber \nstalking is rejection in love or one sided love, harassment, revenge and show -\noff by the offender.  \nFollowing are the methods use by the cyber  stalker to target the \nvictim: - \n1. The stalker if he is a associates of the victim then he can gather all \nthe information about the victim easily and if he is stranger then he collect all \nthe information through internet from various social network sites a nd collect \nall and every information about the victim from Date of birth, place of \nresidence, place of work, phone numbers, email ID \u2019s to places of visits \neverything.  \n2. The stalker may post all the information on any website related to \nsex-services or dat ing service, and uses filthy and obscene language to invite \nP a g e  | 54 \n \nperson as if the victim himself posted these information so the interested \nperson may call the victim on his numbers to have sexual services.  \n3. All the people from the world would call the victim s on his phone \nnumbers at home or on mobile asking for sexual services.  \n 4. Some will send e -mail to the victim attaching pornographic material \nwith it and sometimes posted these emails on the pornographic sites.  \n5. Some will post morphed pictures of the v ictim on these \npornographic and sex -service websites or keep asking for favour and threaten \nthem if they do not fulfill their demands then they will put these pictures all \nover the internet.  \n6. Sometimes the stalkers send them repetitive e -mails and call t hem \nday and night at his phone numbers and keep track on them. The stalkers \nsometimes get the help of third party to harass the victim.  \nThe S ocial Networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Orkut, Google \nplus, I nstagram and many more are becoming a medium to cyber stalking  in \nthe modern world.  \n6.2.1 Legal Recognition and Position in India  \nThough the behaviour widely identified as stalking has existed for \ncenturies, the legal system has only codified its presence in the statues in the \nrecent decades . Cyber stalking only gather importance after the evolution of \nthe internet in the nineties. The rise in crimes related to cyber stalking through \nthe online medium is an extension of traditional stalking that utilizes a high \ntech modus operandi .  \nIn each jurisdiction the statute is different as far as cyber stalking is \nconcerned. In The United States, California is the first state to pass the anti \nstalking law in 1990. But as far as the stalking through computers is conce rned \nthere are few states or countries that passed laws related to cyber stalking.  \nP a g e  | 55 \n \nIndian law do recognise cyber stalking but we do not have law to deal \nwith this issue specifically. The Information Technology act 2000 doesn \u2019t \ncontain any provision regarding cyber stalking or cyber bullying or cyber \nharassment. It is glaring lapse on the part of the government agencies.  \nThe gravity of cyber stalking came into focus in India with Ritu \nKohli \u2019s Case , is the first case in India dealing with cyber stalki ng. The Delhi \nPolice arrested  Manish Kathuria  the culprit of the case. In the said case, \nManish was stalking a person called Ritu Kohli on the Net by illegally \nchatting on the website www.mirc.com with the name of Ritu Kohli. Manish \nwas regularly chatting under the identity of Ritu Kohli on the said Website, \nusing obscene and obnoxious language, was distributing her residence \ntelephone number and inviting chatter to chat with her on telephone.  \nConsequently Ritu Kohli was getting obscene calls from different  chatters \nfrom various parts of India and abroad. Ritu Kohli reported the matter to the \npolice and the Delhi Police swung into action. The police had registered the \ncase under Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code for outraging the modesty of \nRitu Kohli.  But Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code only refers to word, \ngesture or act intended to insult modest of a woman. But when same things are \ndone on internet, then there is no mention about it in the said section. None of \nthe conditions mentioned in the secti on cover cyber stalking. Ritu Kohli \u2019s case \nwas an alarm to the Government, to make laws regarding the aforesaid crime \nand regarding protection of victims under the same. As a result Section 66A of \nthe Information Technology Act, 2008 .55  \nHowever,  now the In dian Information technology Amended Act \n200856 directly address es cyber stalking. The provision for regulating cyber \nstalking in India is section 66A which runs as follows;  \n                                                           \n55 http://www.legalindia.com/cyber -stalking -the-impact -of-its-legislative -provisions -in-india/ \n(Accessed on 11th of February, 2016)  \n56 Information Technology Amendment Act, 2008, Act no 10 of 2009  \nP a g e  | 56 \n \nPunishment for sending offensive messages through \ncommunication service, etc.57: any person, who sends, by means of a \ncomputer resource or a communication device,   \na) Any information that is grossly offensive or has menacing character; \nor  \nb) Any information which he knows to be false, but for the purpose of \ncausing annoyance, inconvenienc e, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal \nintimidation, enmity, hatred, or ill will, persistently makes by making use of \nsuch computer resource or a communication device;  \nc) Any electronic mail or electronic mail message for the purpose of \ncausing a nnoyance or inconvenience or to deceive or to mislead the addressee \nor recipient about the origin of such messages,   \nShall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to \nthree years and with fine.  \nIncidents like sending persistent text mass ages and sexually explicit \nphotographs/MMS have emerged in the recent past as major cyber offences. \nThe intent behind this section is curbing the menance of sending offensive \nmassages by means of computer resource or through internet device. The \noffences l ike obscenity, cyber stalking, defamation, bullying etc. come under \nthe ambit of this section.  \nHowever critics felt that section 66A would be used as a tool to curb \nindividual freedom of speech and expression and violative of article 19(1) of \nthe constitution of India, and in year 2015 in the writ petition titled as Shreya \nSinghal v. Union of India58 the Apex court struck down the section 66A of \nInformation Technology Amendment Act 2008, as it is grossly misused by the \nauthorities and violative of Article 19(1)  of Constitution o f India.  \n                                                           \n57 Ibid, s. 66A  \n58 WP (Crl.) No. 167 of 2012  \nP a g e  | 57 \n \nThus now,  Infor mation T echnology  Amendment  Act 2008 does not \ndirectly address stalking. But t he problem is dealt more as an \u201c intrusion on to \nthe privacy of individual\u201d  than as regular cyber offences which are discussed \nin the IT Act 2008. Hence the most used provision for regulating cyber \nstalking in India is section 72  and 72A  of the Information Technology  \nAmendment  Act, 2008 which runs as follows59; \nBreach of confidentiality and privacy60:  \nSave as otherwise provided in this Act or any other law for the time \nbeing in force, any person who, in pursuant of any of the powers conferred \nunder this Act, rules or regulations made there under, has secured access to \nany electronic record, book, register, correspondence, information, document \nor other material without the consent of the person concerned discloses such \nelectron ic record, book, register, correspondence, information, document or \nother material to any other person shall be punished with imprisonment for a \nterm which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to one \nlakh rupees, or with both.  \nPunishment for Disclosure of information in breach of lawful \ncontract:61 \nSave as otherwise provided in this Act or any other law for the time \nbeing in force, any person including an intermediary who, while providing \nservices under the terms of lawful contra ct, has secured access to any material \ncontaining personal information about another person, with the intent to cause \nor knowing that he is likely to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain discloses, \nwithout the consent of the person concerned, or in breach of a lawful contract, \nsuch material to any other person shall be punished with imprisonment for a \n                                                           \n59 http://www.haltabuse.org/resources/laws/india.shtml (Accessed on 12th February, 2016)  \n60 Information Technology Amendment Act, 2008, s. 72  \n61 Ibid,  s. 72A  \nP a g e  | 58 \n \nterm which may extend to three years, or with a fine which may extend to five \nlakh rupees, or with both.  \nHowever, after the December, 2012 Delhi gang rape inc idence, the \nIndian government has enacted or amended several new laws. In this anti -\nstalking law was also passed . The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013 added \nS.354D to the Indian Penal Code to define and punish the act of stalking.  This \nis as follows \u2013  \nSection 354D62. (1) Any man who \u2014 \n(i) Follows  a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact such woman \nto foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest \nby such woman; or  \n(ii) Monitors  the use by a woman of the internet, emai l or any other \nform of electronic communication, commits the offence of stalking:  \nProvided that such conduct shall not amount to stalking if the man who \npursued it proves that \u2014 \n(i) it was pursued for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime and \nthe man  accused of stalking had been entrusted with the responsibility of \nprevention and detection of crime by the State; or  \n(ii) It was pursued under any law or to comply with any condition or \nrequirement imposed by any person under any law; or  \n(iii) In the part icular circumstances such conduct was reasonable and \njustified.  \n(2) Whoever commits the offence of stalking shall be punished on first \nconviction with imprisonment of either description for a term which may \nextend to three years, and shall also be liable t o fine; and be punished on a \n                                                           \n62 Inserted by Section 7 of \u2018The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013  \nP a g e  | 59 \n \nsecond or subsequent conviction, with imprisonment of either description for a \nterm which may extend to five years, and shall also be liable to fine.  \nIn July 2015, the Metropolitan Magistrate court convicted a senior \nexecutive of a private company in a cyber stalking case for four months \nimprisonment.

Considering the sheer magnitude of \ndependence that the mode rn world places on technology, it would logically \nmake a fine target if a war were to ensue.66   \nCyber Terrorism becomes an international threat to the global \npopulation as through the terrorism , the terrorist are spreading false \npropaganda in line with political and religious ideologies. The word \u201cCyber \nTerrorism\u201d is of recent vintage and was coined by computer whiz Barry C. \nCollin67. The Term cyber terrorism is the combination of cyberspace and \nterrorism and we do not have any definition of cyber terrorism which can be \naccepted worldwide. Every researcher or scholar in the subject gives a \ndifferent dimension while defining the term cyber terrorism. In this research \nthe definition of cyber terrorism is divided into i ntent based and effect based. \nIt refers to attacks on the computers, networks and network grids of the \ncountry which heavily depend on networks and create havoc or fear among the \nminds of its citizens.    \n6.3.1 Definition of Cyber Terrorism  \nThe definition of cyber terrorism cannot be made extensive as the \nnature of crime is such that it must be left to be comprehensive  in nature. The \nnature of \u201c cyberspace\u201d is such that new mode and tools are invented regularly\u037e \nHence it is not wise to put the de finition in a straightjacket formula or pigeons \nhole. In fact, the first effort of the judiciary  should be to understand  the \n                                                           \n66 Dr. Sirohi M.

Most \nnotably, Dorothy Denning, a professor of computer science, has put forward \nan admirably unambiguous definition before the House Armed Services \nCommittee in May 2000: \u201cCyber terrorism is the convergence of cyberspace \nand terrorism. It refers to unlawful attacks and threats of attacks against \ncomputers, networks and the information stored therein when done to \nintimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or \nsocial objectives. Further, to qualify as cyber terrorism, an attack should \nresult in violence against persons or property, or at least cause enough harm \nto generate fear. Attacks that lead to death or bodily injury, explosions, or \nsevere economic loss would be e xamples. Serious attacks against critical \ninfrastructures could be acts of cyber terrorism, depending on their impact. \nAttacks that disrupt nonessential services or that are mainly a costly nuisance \nwould not.\u201d69 \nAccording to NATO (2008), cyber terrorism is  \u201ca cyber -attack using \nor exploiting computer or communication networks to cause sufficient \ndestruction to generate fear or intimidate a society into an ideological \ngoal.\u201d70 \nThe US National Infrastructure Protection Centre, a part of the \nDepartment for Homeland Security: \u201ca criminal act perpetrated through \ncomputers resulting in violence, death and/or destruction, and creating terror \nfor the purpose of coercing a government to change its policies.\u201d  71 \nIn the Federal Government, the FBI describes cyber terrorism as: \n\u201cCyber -terrorism is a criminal act perpetrated by the use of computers and \n                                                           \n68 http://www.naavi.org/cl_editorial_04/praveen_dalal/pd_cy ber_terrorism_oct25_04_02.htm \n(Accessed on 13the February, 2016)  \n69 http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/sr119.pdf (Accessed on 13the February, 2016)  \n70 NATO, (2008).

In Present scenario the aim of the terrorist organizatio n is to \ndestroy the communication, infrastructure, transportation and financial \nnetwork of the country through the use of computers and networks to create \nfear in the minds of the people , as every country in the world is heavily \ndepend on the technology.  Recent attacks in India as well as in world have \nproved that the terrorist are also utilizing the computers and networking to \ncarryout terrorist attacks.  \n6.3.2 Objectives of Cyber Terrorism  \nThe Basic objective of the cyber terrorist organization while attac king \na nation, a place and an organization, to destroy tangible property or assets and \nkilling human beings to prove their agenda or political ideologies, Thus there \nis no doubt that technology advancement in computers and networking has \nplayed a vital par t in providing them opportunity, which influenced terrorists \nmethods and behaviour  considerably . The researcher can identify three main \nobjectives of cyber terrorism:  \n1. This organizational objective of cyber terrorism includes functions \nlike recruiting, instigation training, fundraising, communication, planning, \nspying, etc. Following the intelligence reports, terrorist groups nowadays \nrecourse to the Internet on a daily -basis. Their knowledge and skills in regard \nto computer technology is steadily growin g and this build -up of knowledge \nand skills would eventually provide the necessary expertise for finding and \nexploiting vulnerabilities in the online security systems of governments or \ncritical infrastruc ture institutions .76 \nAlthough those researching the t errorist use of the Internet often \ndescribe them as radical factions seeking some sort of virtual jihad, the actors \ncommitting cyber terrorism do not have to be religiously motivated. \nFurthermore, the organizational function of cyber terrorism enables the \n                                                           \n76 Wilson, C.

Self-explanatory, the goal which terrorists seek to achieve here is to \nhinder the normal functioning of computer systems, services, or websites. The \nmethods used are defacing, denying, and exposing. Since the Western \ncountries are highly dependent on online structures supporting vital services, \nthese methods are of proven merit. However, disruptive activities usually do \nnot entail grave consequences, exc ept perhaps in cases of an unpredictable \nknock -on effect.78  \n3. This  purpose is directed towards achieving the same or similar \nresults as classical terrorism, it is labeled pure cyber terrorism. Through the \nuse of computer technology and the Internet, the t errorists seek to inflict \ndestruction or damage on tangible property or assets, and even death or injury \nto individuals. There are no cases of pure cyber terrorism up to date, but \nperhaps its occurrence is only a matter of time, given the fact that the sta tes\u2019 \ncritical infrastructures have significant security flaws.79 \n6.3.3 Whether the Threat is real or not  \nThe danger caused  by cyber terrorism has grabbed the attention of the \nmass media, the security community, IT industries , Defence sector , politicians , \nand exper ts in variety of  fields have popularized a scenario  in which cyber  \nterrorists  electronically break into computers that control dams or air traffic \ncontrol systems, wreaking havoc and endangering not only millions of live s \nbut national security its elf.80  \n                                                           \n77 Brickey, J.

Because most \ncritical infrastructure in today \u2019s world  is networked through computers, the \npotential threat from cyber terrorism  is very alarming. cyber terrorist through \nthe help of Hackers can  gain access to sensitive information and to the \noperation of crucial services  and can cripple or at least disable the military, \nfinancial, and service  sectors of advanced economies.81  \nThe growing reliance  of our societies on computers and internet  has \ncreated a new form of vulnerability, giving terrorists the chance to approach \ntargets that would otherwise be utterly watertight , such as national defense \nsystems and air traffic control systems. The more technologically developed a \ncountry is, the mo re vulnerable it becomes to cyber attacks  against its \ninfrastructure. Concern about the potential danger posed by cyber terrorism  is \nthus well founded.82  \nThe Crime related to cyberspace has been increasing rapidly; however \nthere is no cyber terrorist attack  in Indian  public facilities, transport  systems, \nnuclear power plants, power grids, or other key machinery  of the national \ninfrastructure. Cyber attacks  are regular , but they have not been carried  out by \nterrorists and they have not sought to inflict  the kind of damage that would \nqualify them as cyber terrorism . \n6.3.4 Recent Incident of Cyber Terrorism in World  \nThe following are the number of incident which has created problems \nfor nations or which can be termed as terrorist attack by the terrorist group \nwith the help of information technology in the world \u2013  \nCyber Attacks in Middle East  \nWith the Middle East Conflict at a very heated moment between \nbordering countries Pro -Palestinian and Pro -Israel Cyber Groups have been \nlaunching an offensive against websites and mail services used by the political \nsectors the opposing groups show support  for.

Just prior to and after the \nSeptember 11th attacks, it is believed that the sympathizers of Pakistan began \ntheir spread of propaganda and attacks against Indian Internet based \ncommunities. Group s such as G -Force and Doctor Nuker have defaced or \ndisrupted service to several major entities in India such as the Zee TV \nNetwork, The India Institute of Science and the Bhabha Atomic Research \nCenter which all have political ties. The Group, Pakistani Hac kerz Club also \nwent as far as to target the United States Air Force Computing Environment \nand the Depa rtment of Energy \u2019s Website.84  \nRetribution by China  \nIn May 1999 the accidental bombing of a Chinese embassy in \nYugoslavia by U.S .

This took the form of demonstrations and even riots. But \nthen something extraordinary happened: quickly, and wholly without warning, \nthe whole country was subjected to a barrage of cyber -warfare, disabling the \nwebsites of government ministries, political parties, banks and newspapers. \nTechniques normally employed by cybercriminals, such as huge remotely -\ncontrolled networks of hijacked computers, were used to cripple vital public \nservices. NATO has sent its top cyber -terrorism experts to Tallinn, with \nwestern democracies caught on the hop over the implications of such an \nattack. The E stonian defence ministry said: \u201c We\u2019ve been lucky to survive this. \nIf an airport, bank or state infrastructure is attacked by a missile, it\u2019s clear \nwar but if the same result  is done  by computer \u2019s, then what do you  call It.

India is in developing stage and the impact of cyber attack on \nIndian infrastructure and communication is going to be immense, because \nIndia now h eavily depends on computers and information Technology.  \nThere is need of series of innovative laws and global standards on \ndealing with cyber crimes . The Computer/Internet is changing the process of \nknowledge creation and dissemination of information as well as deeper \ntransmission is taking place towards redefining the communication process. \nThus a fine balance can be achieved between terrorism and Law enforcement \nwith due care and consideration.

The concept of counter  strike \nthrough aggressive defence presupposes the adoption and use of information \ntechnology to produce legitimate and legalized disabling and rea sonably \ndestructive effects. Some adopted measures completely destroys the \nfunctioning of the offending computer while others simply disable the \ncomputer for the time being by either shutting it down or making it \ntemporarily non -functional. The technology adopted must not only be safe and \neffective, but it must also be \u201c legal and law -abiding \u201d. A counter -measure, \nwhich is not very accurate, and law abiding would be a remedy worst than the \nmalady and hence it should be avoided. For instance, if a virus has be en \nlaunched by using a public server, then by disabling that server the genuine \nand legitimate users will be unnecessarily harassed and they would be denied \nthe services which they are otherwise entitled to. Thus, the countermeasure \nmeasure adopted must be  job specific and not disproportionate to the injury \nsought to be remedied .91  \nIn March 2013 , suspected Chinese hackers breached the computers of  \nIndia \u2019s top military organisation, the Defence Research and Development \nOrganisation (DRDO), in what was touted  to be amongst the biggest such \nsecurity breaches in the Indian  history.

It \nis said that hacking erodes the faith of  people in information technology and \nthe Internet. Hacking  a computer  system has been projected as a menace  \nrequiring harsh laws to act as deterrents. Such a general  projection is \nsomewhat misconceived.  \nHacking a computer simply implies getting into  another \u2019s computer \nwithout permission. Gaining unlawful  access to another \u2019s computer is \nhacking. Unauthorized  entry into a computer belonging to another is hacking. \nIt is  equivalent to phone -tapping. Hackers see the weakness in  the target \ncomputer programme and then find ways to enter  and access therein. Anti -\nhacking tools such a s the \u2018Firewall \u2019 technology and intrusion detection \nsystems are preventive  measures that can be taken to protect a computer from  \nbeing ha cked. Firewall, like a wall of fi re, prevents hacking.  Intrusion \ndetection systems will in addition also try to  detect the source of hacking.  \nHacking perse , in simple terms, is criminal trespass  into a computer \nthat is a private property. Criminal  trespass under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 \nis simply  defined as entering into property in the possession of  another with \nintent  to commit an offence or to intimidate,  insult or annoy any person in \npossession of such property,  or having lawfully entered into or upon such \nproperty, by  unlawfully remaining there with intent thereby to  intimidate, \n                                                           \n95 Ibid \nP a g e  | 77 \n \ninsult or annoy any such person or wi th intent  to commit an offence.96 \nCriminal trespass entails a  punishment of imp risonment upto three months or \nfine upto rupees five hundred, or with both97 Criminal trespass  perse  is thus a \nminor offence.  \nHere is a short list of great hackers of the world.  \nThe most famous hacker in the history is Kevin Mitnick. At the tender \nage of 17 in 1981, he hacked into a phone exchange that allowed him to \nredirect subscriber calls in any way he wanted. In 1983, he accessed a \nPentagon computer. In 1990s, he cracked/ hack ed/broke into the  computer \nsystems of the world \u2019s top technology and  telecommunications companies like \nNokia, Fujitsu,  Motorola and Sun Microsystems. He was arrested by the  FBI \nin 1995 and later released on parole in 2000.98 \nGary McKinnon, an Englishman, was arrested in  November 2002 on \nthe accusation that he had hacked into  more than 90 US military computer \nsystems in the U.K.99  \nVladmir Le vin, a Russian computer \u2018expert \u2019 is said to be the  \ufb01rst to \nhack a bank to steal money. In early 1995, he hacked into  Citibank and robbed \nUS$ 10 million. He was arrested by  Interpol in the U.K. in 1995, after he had \ntransferred money to  his accounts in the US, Finland, Holland, Germany and \nIsrael.100  \nA Los Angeles radio station announced a contest that  would reward the \n102nd caller with a \u2018Porsche 944S2 \u2019. Kevin Poulsen took control of the entire \ncity\u2019s telephone  network and ensured he was the winner being the 102nd caller. \nHe also hacked into \u2018Arpanet \u2019 that was the precursor  to the Internet. Arpanet \nwas a global network of computers.101 \n                                                           \n96 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 441  \n97 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 44 7 \n98 http://www.funonthenet.in/forums/in dex.php?topic=1260.0;wap2 (Accessed on 20th \nFebruary, 2016)  \n99 Ibid \n100 Ibid \n101 Ibid \nP a g e  | 78 \n \nUS based hacker Timothy Lloyd planted a malicious  software code in \nthe computer network of Omega  Engineering which was a prime supplier of \ncomponents to  NASA and the US Navy. Omega lost US$10 million due to  the \nattack by which its manufacturing  operations were  impaired.102 \nSpecies of criminal trespass have been treated with  more deterrent \npunishments. For instance, punishment for  house -trespass is punishable with \nimprisonment upto one  year.103 House -trespass in order to commit an offence  \npunishable with death (i.e. murder etc.) is punishable with  imprisonment for \nlife or rigorous imprisonment upto ten  years.104 House -trespass in order to \ncommit an offence  punishable with imprisonment for life is punishable with  \nimprisonment upto ten years.105 House -tresp ass, other than  the above, entails \npunishment with imprisonment  extending to two years and if the offence \nintended to be  committed is theft, the term of the imprisonment may  extend to \nseven years.106 For house -trespass committed  after preparation to cause hu rt, \nassault or wrongful  restraint or putting any person in such fear, the  punishment \nprescribed is imprisonment extending to seven  years.107 Lurking house -\ntrespass or housebreaking is  punishable with imprisonment extending to two \nyears.108 Lurking house -trespass or housebreaking in order to  commit an \noffence punishable with imprisonment, is liable  for imprisonment upto three \nyears and if such intended  offence is theft, the term of imprisonment has been  \nextended to ten years.109 The punishment for lurk ing house -trespass or \nhousebreaking by night is punishable with  impriso nment extending to three \nyears.110 Grievous hurt  caused whilst committing lurking house -trespass or  \nhousebreaking, is punishable with imprisonment for life, or  impri sonment \n                                                           \n102 Ibid \n103 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 44 8  \n104 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 44 9 \n105 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 4 50 \n106 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 4 51 \n107 Indian Penal Code, 1860.,  s. 452 \n108 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 4 53 \n109 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 4 54 \n110 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 4 56 \nP a g e  | 79 \n \nextending to t en years.111 All persons jointly  concerned in lurking house -\ntrespass or housebreaking by  night, are liable to be punished with \nimprisonment for life  or extending to ten years, where  death or grievous hurt is  \ncaused or attempted to be caused by any one or mor e of them.112 \nAnother instance of an offence that has numerous  species is \n\u201cmischief\u201d. Every specie s of mischief is separately  laid down in the I.P.C. \nwith differing punishments,  depend ing upon the magnitude thereof.113 Many \nof the  offences in the I.P.C. such as robbery, criminal breaches of trust, \ncheating etc., have  their respective species that are  treated differently from one \nanother.   \nThe legal approach towards hacking should be the same  as that of \ncriminal trespass, mischief an d the innumerable  other offences in the I.P.C. \nAll forms of hacking cannot be  treated alike. It needs to be understood that \nhacking too has  numerous dimensions and species like other offences.  \nA person who enjoys exploring computer systems is also  a hacker. \nMany teenagers obsessed with the Internet and  computers hack for fun and \nexcitement. Excitement to  make an impact, show of capability and knowledge \nof computers, fun and publicity, and the desire to explore are  some of the \nmotives of these teenager s to hack into  computer systems.  \nAnother form of hacking is by Internet security  companies, to test the \ncomputer systems of their clients and  potential clients, to impress them and get \nbusiness  assignments of setting up security systems for the clients.   \nHacking is also committed to damage the business of  competitors and \nenemies. Disruption of a computer and  denial of access to a person authorized \nto access any  computer, are some of the damages that may be caused by  \nhacking. Hacking is also done to spy int o others  computer  systems and for \nstealing information/data residing therein.  Hacking is also used as a Weapon \n                                                           \n111 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 4 59 \n112 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 4 60 \n113 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 4 25-440 \nP a g e  | 80 \n \nto commit other crimes  such as cheating and misappropriation of funds  \nelectronically from the bank account of another.  \nHacking is done at the cou ntry level too. Frequently,  Pakistani hackers \nare accused of hacking Indian web -sites.  For instance, the web -site of SEBI \n(Stock Exchange Board  of India) was hacked whereby a link to a pornographic \nweb-site was inserted.  \nHacktivists are protestors against  governments or  institutions / \norganizations, who protest through hacking.  For instance, anti -globalization \nprotests have been made  through hacking the web -site of WTO.  \nThere are therefore numerous species of hacking,  though in essence, it \nis the offence of criminal trespass. All  forms of hacking cannot thus be treated \nalike. It is the  intent, purpose and consequences of hacking that  determine its \ngravity. A twelve year old, who, for  excitement and playing a prank enters \nrestricted web -sites,  should not be  treated as a national enemy. A terrorist  \norganization hacking into a protected system such as the  defence computer \nsystems to steal nuclear secrets, or a  criminal syndicate hacking to \nmisappropriate huge  amounts, cannot be treated on par with a teenager p rying  \ninto the computer system of his best friend \u2019s girlfriend or  even the CBI \n(Central Bureau of Investigation) for fun and  excitement. The nature of the \nhacking determines the  gravity and all forms of hacking should not be \nprojected or  legally treated in  the same manner. Hacking has so many  species. \nHacking is a skill that can be used positively as well  as negatively. A man \nopening locks to help people who have  lost the key is a locksmith. However, a \nperson who opens  locks to steal is a thief.  \nThe serious ness of hacking depends upon the nature,  purpose, intent \nand the extent of loss and injury that are  caused to the victim. For instance, in \na reported incident in  the U.S. , the owner of a hobby web -site for children  \nreceived an e -mail informing her that a g roup of hackers  had gained control \nover her web -site. They demanded a  ransom of one million dollars. The threat \nwas overlooked as  a mere scare tactic. A few days late, she discovered that the  \nP a g e  | 81 \n \nhackers had \u2018web-jacked \u2019 her web -site. \u2018Web -jacking \u2019 has been equated with \nhijacking an aeroplane, as forcibly  assuming control of a web -site, for diverse \nmotives. The  hackers had altered a p art of the web -site which said \u201c How  to \nhave fun with goldfish\u201d. The word \u201cgoldfish\u201d  was replaced  with \u201cpiranhas\u201d . \nPiranhas are tiny but extremely dangerous  flesh eating fish. Many children \nvisiting the web -site, purchased \u2018piranhas \u2019 from pet shops and tried playing \nwith them, thereby hurting themselves badly. 114 \nHacking in various forms is already part of several  offences, either as \nthe means to their commission or as a  consequence. For instance, hacking \ncould be a tool and  means to commit cheating, misappropriation, criminal  \nbreach of trust, theft, copyright violations, spying into  official secrets, or as \npart of the conspiracy to  wage war  against the Stat e, that are all well defi ned \noffences.  Some of the species of hacking have been defi ned as  contraventions \nas well as criminal offences in the LT. Act,  2000 as amended by the I .T. \n(Amendment) Act, 2008. In the  original version of t he I.T. Act, 2000, section \n66 defi ned and  punished hacking in the following terms:  \n\u201cHacking with Computer System - (1) Whoever with the intent to cause \nor knowing that he is likely to cause wrongful loss or damage to the public or \nany person destroys or de letes or alters any information residing in a \ncomputer resource or diminishes its value or utility or affects is injuriously by \nany means, commits hacking.  \n(2) Whoever commits hacking shall be punished with imprisonment up \nto three years, or with fine whic h may extend upto two lakh rupees, or with \nboth\u201d.115 \nThe title of the aforesaid section 66 was a misnomer,  which created \nconfusion. It was widely believed as if section  66 was the only legal provision \nthat dealt with the offence  of hacking a computer system. This confusion has \n                                                           \n114 \u201cHack Attack\u201d  by Shuchi Nagpal, Asian School of Cyber Laws in Indian Express Vigil,  \nMarch 2002. also available at http://www.asianlaws.org/press/hack_attack.htm  (Accessed on \n20th February, 2016)  \n115 Information Technology Act, 2000., s. 66  \nP a g e  | 82 \n \nbeen done  away with, by certain amendments made by the I .T.

Viruses can also replicate themselves. \nAll computer viruses are man -made. A simple virus that can make a  copy  of itself over and \nover again is relatively easy to produce. Even such a simple virus is dangerous because it will \nquickly use all available memory  and bring the  system  to a halt.

In 1988, one of  the most common viruses, \n\u2018Jerusalem \u2019 was unleashed. This  virus was activated every Friday the 13th and \naffected both  \u2018.exe\u2019 and \u2018.com \u2019 \ufb01les and deleted any programs run on that  day. \nIn 1990, Syman tec launched \u2018Norton Anti -virus \u2019 that was amongst the \ufb01rst \nanti-virus programs developed by a  large company. In 1992, it was discovered \nthat 1300 viruses  were in existence, that was an increase of 420% from  \nDecember, 1990. This was the year when the \u2018Dark Avenger  Mutation \nEngine \u2019 (DAME) was created, which was a toolkit  that turned viruses into \npolymorphic viruses. In 1994, the  \u2018Good Times \u2019 e-mail hoax tore through the \ncomputer  community. The hoax  warns of a malicious virus that would  erase \nan entire hard -drive just by opening an e -mail with  the subject line \"Good  \nTimes\". In 1995, \u2018Word Concept \u2019 became one of the most prevalent viruses, \nwhich spread  through Microsoft Word documen ts.

In 2003, the \u2018Slammer \u2019 worm, the fastest  spreading worm till \ndate, infected about 75000 computers  in ten minutes. This year, the \u2018Sobig \u2019 \nworm became amongst  the \ufb01rst few worms to make the infected computer \nsystems  spam relay points.  In the year 2004,  a computer worm called \n\u2018MyDoom \u2019 or \u2018Novarg \u2019 spread through e -mails and fi le-sharing software  \nfaster than its earlier cousins. \u2018MyDoom \u2019 enticed e -mail recipients to open an \nattachment that allowed hackers to  access the hard -drive of the afflicted \ncomp uter system.

Act , 2000  imposes a monetary liability  of \nupto rupees one crore upon a person who, without the  permission of the owner \nor incharge of a computer,  introduces or causes to be introduced any computer  \ncontaminant or computer virus into any computer,  computer system or \ncomputer network. \u201cComputer virus\u201d means any computer instruction, \ninformation, data o r programme that destroys, damages, degrades or adversely  \naffects the performance of a computer resource or attaches  itself to another \ncomputer resource and operates when a  programme, data or instruction is \nexecuted or some other  event takes place in that computer resource. \n\u201cComputer  contaminant\u201d means any set of computer instructions that  are \ndesigned - \n\uf0b7 to modify, destroy, record, transmit data or  programme residing \nwithin a computer, computer  system or computer network; or  \n\uf0b7 by any means to usurp the normal operation of the  computer, \ncomputer system, or computer network;  \n                                                           \n119 http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0872842.html (Accessed on 01 March, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 86 \n \nSection 43 imposes a strict liability upon the person who  plants any \ncomputer virus or contaminant. All the violations stipulated in section 43 \nincluding  clause (c) that covers the violation of introduction or  causing the \nintroduction of any computer contaminant or  computer virus into any \ncomputer, have also been made  criminal offences.120 Hence, dishonestly or \nfraudulently  introducing or causing the introduction of a computer virus  or \ncomputer contaminant i nto another \u2019s computer, would  also constitute a \ncriminal offence entailing an  imprisonment of two years. Even with mens rea, \nto penalize  the introduction of computer contaminant or virus into  another \u2019s \ncomputer, in the present state of informa tion technology in our country, is \ntotally unjustified. Our law  makers should have at least asked themselves \ncertain  fundamental questions before criminalizing the planting of  computer \nvirus and contaminants: - \n\uf0b7 What is the level of general awareness in our country  about computer \ncontaminants and virus ? \n\uf0b7 How many people in our country, who use computers,  are aw are of \nanti-virus software and how many out of  them use the same?  \n\uf0b7 What is the general level of consciousness amongst people, that \nbefore sending a computer file to  another through a CD, \ufb02oppy, pen -drive or \nthe Internet, it should be checked whether there is virus  in it or not?  \n\uf0b7 With computer contaminants and virus floating everywhere in \nfloppies, CDs, pen -drives and the Internet, how will it be proven  prima facie \nor otherwise, as to who introduced/transmitted the  contaminants or virus in \nquestion?  \n\uf0b7 Are our law enforcement agencies and the judiciary equipped to \ndetermine the source of the computer  contaminant and virus?  \nIt is extremely difficult to fi nd the source of a virus and  contaminant in \na computer system. The offence of planting  virus and contaminant in a \n                                                           \n120 Sec. 66 of the I.T. Act, 2000 as ame nded by the I.T. (Amendment) Act, 2008.  \nP a g e  | 87 \n \ncomputer system is susceptible  to gross misuse and erroneous application. The \nauthor of a  virus and contaminant, who infects multiple computer  systems, \nlike the viruses and worms discussed above, would  stand on a different \nfooting. A harsh liability including  corporal punishment, on the author of a \nvirus that is  circulated by him, is justifiable. However, to prosecute  persons \nwho merely transmit vi rus and contaminants is ex -facie draconian. There is \nhardly any awareness in our  country about computer virus and contaminants \nor anti -virus software. Our law enforcement agencies have no  expertise to \ndetermine the precise source of the virus. It is  practically very difficult to \nlocate the source of a virus,  especially  with viruses and contaminants fl oating \nin the  cyber world like dust, an d virus that causes common cold. Our \nlegislators ought to have conceived various other  situations and problems. Fo r \ninstance, a person may not  even know that there is virus in his computer. New \ntypes of  virus come into existence from time to time and many of  them are not \ndetectable by anti -virus software. Hence, even  if a person installs anti -virus \nsoftware, virus can  creep into  the computer and unknowingly such virus can \nbe transmi tted to others. Since intention/mens rea is inferred  from the incident \nand its consequences, apart from the  allegations by the complainant, false and \nmisconceived  criminal cases alleging pla nting virus and contaminants are  \nlikely to be galore in our country. Adding insult to injury, it  would be only at \nthe end of the ordeal of facing prosecution -cum-persecution, that the accused \nwould get an  opportunity to prove his innocence during defence  evidence.  \nTo make transmission of virus and contaminants, a  criminal offence, \nshould have waited for our people to  mature as users of computers and the \nInternet, which would  take at least another fifteen to twenty years. A nominal \nfine like a traffi c challa n to start with, would have suffi ced and  the law should \nhave evolved with the growth of awareness,  consciousness and maturity \namongst computer users at  large. Transmission of virus or contaminant, as a \ncivil violation under section 43 of the IT Act, 2000 with a  nominal fi ne is still \njustifiable.  \nP a g e  | 88 \n \nHowever, dealing with the law as it is, a heavy  responsibility lies on \nour judiciary to protect citizens from  harassment of being implicated for \ntransmitting computer  virus and contaminants. It would be a tragic comedy to \nsee every computer user in the country as the complainant/victim of computer \ncontaminants and virus, and also a  criminal being accused of introducing \ncomputer virus and/ or contaminants into another \u2019s computer . \n 6.6 Cyber  Crimes  related  to Finance  \n The Price Waterhouse Coopers organization, which deals with the \neconomic crime survey, has defined economic crime in cyber world as \u201can \neconomic crime committed using computers and the internet. It includes \ndistributing viruses, illegally downl oading files, phishing and pharming, and \nstealing personal information like bank account details. It \u2019s only a cyber \ncrime if a computer, or computers, and the internet play a central role in the \ncrime, and not an incidental one. \u201d121  \n According to the findings of survey on Economic Crime in India in  \nGlobal Economic Crime Survey 2011. The use of the internet in India is \ngrowing rapidly. According to a recent Telecom Regulatory Authority of India \n(TRAI) survey, we currently have 354 million internet subsc ribers.122 While \nburgeoning growth in the use of internet provides multiple options to cyber \ncitizens in all  possible spheres from  entertainment to education, it has also \ngiven rise to cyber crime. This new breed of tech -savvy fraudsters poses  a new \nset of c hallenges. 24% of the respondents,  who reported economic crime, have \nexperienced cyber crime in the last 12 months. We believe that this data alone \nshows how serious the risk of cyber crime is to organizations . In the \nbackground of the recent incidents of cyber crime on multinational  companies \nand financial institutions, a greater number of organizations  are becoming \nvictims of cyber crime. One potential reason that may explain this sudden rise \n                                                           \n121 As defined in the Global Economic Crime Survey 2011 by PwC in conjunction with our \nsurvey academic partner, Professor Peter Sommer  \n122 http://www.trai.gov.in/  \nP a g e  | 89 \n \nin cyber crime is the rise in the volume of e -business, greater  penetration of \ninternet and e -commerce.  \n Economic crime does not discriminate. It is truly global. No industry \nor organization  is immune. We have seen that despite fraud being a serious \nbusiness issue, 10% of the respondents in 2011 as compared to 6% in 2009 \nwas not aware if their organization has been a victim to economic crime in the \nlast 12 months. The reason for awareness lev els being low can be attributed, to \nan extent, to the frequency of performing fraud risk assessment. One third of \nthe respondents to the survey do not perform fraud risk assessment due to a \nperceived lack of value. This trend is exposing more organizations  to the risk \nof fraud. The fallout isn \u2019t just the direct costs: economic crime can seriously \ndamage employee morale, brands or tarnish reputation, leading organizations \nto lose market share. As society becomes less tolerant of unethical behaviour, \nbusiness es need to make sure they are building \u2013 and keeping \u2013 public trust. \nToday, most people and businesses rely on the internet and other technologies. \nAs a result, they are potentially opening themselves up to attacks from \ncriminals anywhere in the world. Aga inst a backdrop of data losses and theft, \ncomputer viruses and hacking, this survey looks at the significance and impact \nof this new type of economic crime and how it affects businesses worldwide.  \nCyber crime ranks as one of the top four types of economic crime. More than \nhalf (58%) perceive Information Technology department as a high risk \ndepartment with resp ect to committing cyber crime.  96% said that their \norganizations  monitor internal and external electronic tr affic and web -based \nactivity. About 80% of  Indian respondents reported that cyber crime threat \noriginates within India or through a combination o f in and outside the country. \nAbout 2/3rd of respondents did not have access to forensic technology tools \nthat are use ful in combating cyber crime. 35% o f respondents did not have any \ncyber security training in the last 12 months . Asset misappropriation has not \nonly been the most common type of economic crime but also shown a \nremarkable increase - 20% in 2007 to 68% in 2011. Nearly two -thirds of the \nP a g e  | 90 \n \nrespon dents found that the perpetrator s were among their own staff. In most \ncases, perpetrators of fraud were male, between the ages of 31 and 40, and \neducat ed to degree level or higher. 80% of respondents said their organization \nterminated the individual who co mmitted the fraud and more than half of the \nrespondents ceased to conduct business with outsiders who e ngaged in \nfraudulent conduct. Despite the growing confidence that organizations \nsurveyed have in their risk management systems most fraud (35 %) is still  \ndetected by chance .123 \n The cyber crime offers low risks and high rewards as compared to \ntraditional crimes. For example, in an externally perpetrated cyber crime, a \nfraudster infiltrates a banking system, remotely, to steal money or personal \ninformation. The fraudster is at a lesser risk when compared to someone who \nphysically steals assets from an organization. There are fewer risks when \ncommitting cyber  crime. The fraudster is not present at the location; hence the \nchance s of getting caught are less. It is difficult for law enforcement agencies \nto follow traditional investigative steps to prosecute the perpetrator owing to \nthe different location and jurisdiction of the perpetrator. The perpetrators can \nreturn to the scene of the crime with relatively mini mal fear of detection.124  \n The Financial Cybercrime includes cheating, credit card frauds, money \nlaundering , forgery, online investment frauds  etc. such crimes are punishable \nunder both IPC and IT Act. A  leading Bank in India was cheated to the extent \nof 1. 39 crores due to  misappropriation of funds by manipulation of computer \nrecords regarding  debit and credit accounts. Most cases involving computer -\nrelated fraud  have been prosecuted under existing criminal legislation and this \nhas been  adequate to cope with  these offences. However applying traditional \ncriminal  concepts to acts involving intangible information has meant that some  \n                                                           \n123 Economic Crime in India: an ever increasing phenomenon,  Global Economic Crime Survey \n2011, India, Price Waterhouse Coopers, 2011. also available at \nhttps://www.pwc.in/assets/pdfs/publications -2011/economic -crime -survey -2011 -india -\nreport.pdf (Retrieved on 17th February, 2016 )  \n124 Ibid \nP a g e  | 91 \n \namendments have proved necessary to resolve issues of applying existing  \ndefinitions to the new technology.  \n There are various legislations in India which deals with the Fraud and  \nrelated activities, some of them are:  Section 25 of Indian Penal Code125 does \nattempt to define the word  fraudulently by saying that there can be no fraud \nunless there is an intention  to defraud. In genera l, fraud is used in different \nways viz.  \n\uf0b7 To deprive a man of his right either by obtaining something by  \ndeception or by taking something wrongfully without the knowledge  or \nconsent of the owner.  \n\uf0b7 To withhold wrongfully from another , what is due to his or to  \nwrongfully prevent one from obtaining what he may justify claim.  \n\uf0b7 To defeat or frustrate wrongfully another \u2019s right to property.  \n\uf0b7 Whenever the words fraud, intent to defraud or an intent to expose  \nsome person to actual or possible injury.  \n\uf0b7 The main intent and  object of the fraudulent person is in every case,  \nhis own advantage.  \n A conclusive test as to the fraudulent character of a deception for \ncriminal  purposes is whether to it is the deceit derived any advantage from it \nwhich  he would not have had if the tru th has been known. If so, that advantage  \nwould generally have an equivalent in less or risk of less to someone  else and \nif so, there is fraud. Fraud encompasses within its fold the scam of the  \nInternet. Both the essential requisites of fraud i.e. deceit or  intention to  deceive \nand actual a possible injury to an individual or a group of  individuals are \npresent in such scams. All such scams whatever their modus  operandi , are \nintended to gain advantage for some almost always at the  risk of loss to others.  \n Sections 415 to 420, IPC detail the law relating to cheating, in the  case \nof Internet Scams relevant sections relating to the crime of cheating  such as \ncheating by impersonation (Section 416) cheating with knowledge  that \n                                                           \n125 Indian Penal Code (Act No. 45 of Year 1860).  \nP a g e  | 92 \n \nwrongful loss may ensure to person whe re interest if offender is bound  to \nprotect (Section 418), etc. may be applied according to the facts of the  case.  \nThe word Fraud is clearly defined under the Indian Contract Act,  1872.126 \nSection 7 - \u201cFraud\u201d Defined: \u201cFraud\u201d means and includes any  of the following \nacts committed by a party to a contract or with his  connivance or by his agent, \nwith intent to deceive another party thereto or  his agent, or to induce him to \nenter into the contract . \n The IT Act, 2000127 deals with the crimes relating to Internet fraud and  \nonline investment fraud in sections 43(d), 65 and 66. Section 43(d)  penalizes a \nperson who damages or causes damage to data. \u2018Damage \u2019, under clause (iv) of \nthe Explanation, means to destroy, alter, add, modify  or rearrange any \ncomputer resource b y any means. Therefore, unauthorized  alteration of data \nwould come within the ambit of section 43 (d) which is  sufficient to cover \ncomputer crimes like issuance of false stocks or market  manipulation schemes \nsince they essentially involve alteration and/or  addition of data. Section 65of \nthe IT Act makes tampering with computer  source code an offence. \u2018Computer \nsource code \u2019 has been defined as the  listing of programmes, computer \ncommands, design and layout and  programme analysis of computer resource \nin any form. Internet fraud would  also come within the scope of section 66 of \nthe IT Act dealing with  wrongful loss or damage to the public or any person \ndue to destruction or  alteration of any data residing in a computer resource or \ndue to diminishing  its value or utility or affecting it injuriously by any means. \nOther related  enactments are the Companies Act, 2013  and the Securities and \nExchange  Board of India Act, 1992 as also sections 415 to 424 of the IPC \npertaining  to cheating.  \n 6.6.1 Recent cases relating t o Financial Cybercrime  \n 1. In 2005 a student of MBBS of Bangalore was arrested; he used to  \npost juicy advertisements for high -performance laptops on different  websites. \n                                                           \n126 The Indian Contract Act, 1872 (Act No. 9 of 1872)  \n127 The Information Technology Act, 2000 (No. 21 of 2000)  \nP a g e  | 93 \n \nMany took the bait and made online purchases but the  laptops never reached \nthem.

Advocates. In this Data  theft case that involved law \nfirm Titus & Co,  its four employees had  illegally copied and removed \nelectronic records including protected  and confidential information from \ncomputers belonging to Titus &  Co. These lawyers later formed a new \norganization relying on the  pilfered data. Thereby  action was brought by Titus \n& Co against  these former employees to restrain them from using the \u201ccopied  \nmaterial\u201d from their erstwhile employer firm .129 \n 3.

Before creating the ID, they change the card holder \u2019s phone \nnumber to their phone number by contacting the customer care of the bank by \nfurnishing all details of the actual card holder. By misusing the above data, the \nfraudsters did online shopping. While making online purchases, they give false  \ndelivery address and their phone number. Once the courier agent calls them \nfor delivering the goods, they insist they come to their office to deliver. To get \nthe goods, they prepared fake ration cards, voter ID cards and PAN cards in \nname of the actual ca rd holder with help of Photoshop software on their laptop \nand by producing the sa me, they get the goods.132  \n 5. In 2013, A con man from Maharashtra who cheated ICICI Bank \ncustomers by obtaining their credit card data has fallen into the Delhi Police \nnet after illegal online transactions of over Rs 1 crore in the past one year. He \nwas misusing the data of around 4,500 credit card holders for the last one -and-\nhalf years, police said, adding that employees of the bank could be involved in \nleaking the data to  him. He, claiming to be an ICICI Bank employee, assured \nthe victim to refund their money. But just after getting the card details, he \nmade an electricity bill payment of Rs 44,911 to Maharashtra district \nelectricity board , there is a strong possibility of  the involvement of employees \nof the ICIC I Bank,\u201d  said SBS Tyagi, deputy commissioner of police.133 \n 6.7 Phishing  and Vishing  \nIn computing, phishing is a form of social engineering, characterized \nby attempts to fraudulently acquire sensitive information, such as passwords \nand credit card details, by masquerading as a trustworthy person or business  in \nan apparently official electronic communication, such as an e -mail or  an \n                                                           \n132 http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/two -persons -held-for-online -credit -card-fraud -\n425297.html (Retrieved on 17th February, 2016 )  \n133 http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/delhi -police -arrests -con-man-for-credit -card-frauds -\n623798.html (Retrieved on 17th February, 2016 )  \nP a g e  | 95 \n \ninstant message.134 The term phishing arises from the use of increasingly  \nsophisticated  lures to \u201cfish\u201d for \u2018users \u2019 financial information and  passwords.  \nThe act of sending an e -mail to a user falsely claiming to be  established \nlegitimate enterprises  in an attempt to scam the user into  surrendering private \ninformation that will be used for id entity theft.   The e -mail directs the user to \nvisit a Website where they are asked to update personal information, such as \npasswords, credit card, social security, and bank account numbers, that the \nlegitimate organization already has. The Website, however , is bogus and set \nup only to steal the user \u2019s information.135 \nThe motive behind phishing is that people will share their credit card \ninformation, passwords, bank account numbers and other information thinking \nthat they are sharing their information to the l egitimate organization but in real \nthey are sharing their information with bogus website or organization which is \ngoing to steal their money.  \nVishing is also alike phishing;  it is the criminal practice of using social \nengineering and Voice over IP (VoIP) to gain access to private .personal  and \nfinancial i nformation from the public for the purpose of financial reward. The \nterm is a combination of \u201cvoice\u201d  and phishi ng. Vishing exploits the public \u2019s \ntrust in landline telephone services, which have traditional ly terminated in \nphysical locations which are known to the telephone company, and associated \nwith a bill -payer. The victim is often unaware that VoIP allows for caller ID \nspoofing, inexpensive, complex automated systems and anonymity for the bill  \npayer. Vi shing is typically used to steal credit card numbers or other \ninformation used in identity theft schemes from individuals.136 \nRecently in a landmark judgment in India in the case of Uma Shankar \nv. ICICI Bank , the Adjudicator of Tamil  Nadu has passed an award  for \n                                                           \n134 Lance James, \u201cPhishing Exposed\u201d, Elsevier 2005. also at  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing (Retrieved on 17th Febru ary, 2016 )  \n135 http://www.crimedoctor.com/phishing -scam.htm (Retrieved on 17th February, 2016)  \n136 Dr. B.

The honorable adjudicator proceeded \nto accept the  petitioner s argument that the Bank had not exercised due \ndiligence and  therefore was liable under Section 85 of  the Act to pay the \ncompensations.137 \nMost methods of phishing use some form of technical deception \ndesigned  to make a link in an e -mail appear to belong to the spoofed \norganization.  Misspelled URLs or the use  of sub  domains are common tricks \nused by  phishers, For example, the link \nhttp://www.google.com@membcrs. abc.co m/ might deceive a casual observer \ninto believing that the link will  open a page on www.google.com, whereas the \nlink actually directs the  browser to a page on members.abc.com, using a \nusername of  www.google.co m; were there no such user, the page would open \nnormally.  This method has since been closed off in the Mozilla and Internet \nExplorer  web browsers, while Opera provides a warning message and the \noption  not to follow the link.138 \nNowadays Phishing attacks are becoming common form of risk in \nInternet  based Banking. Banks have been largely forcing the customers to \nbelieve  that the liability for Phishing should be borne by the customers \nbecause  they were negligent in responding to the Phishing  mail. However, the \nlegal  position can be different. Phishing is a result of multiple contraventions \nof Information Technology Act  2000 particularly after the amendments of \n2008. It results in wrongful  loss to the customer. The contravention therefore \n                                                           \n137 http://www.governancenow.com/news/regular -story/icici -bank -gets-rs-1285 -lakh-lesson -e-\nsecurity and also at http://www.naavi.org / (Retrieved on 17th February, 2016)  \n138 \u201cPhishing, n.\u201d OED Online, March 2006, Oxford University Press.

Additionally, Banks are ignoring the law of  the \nland through IT Act 2000 as well as the Guidelines of RBI and not  using \ndigital signatures for authentication of Internet transactions. This  make s them \nnegligent under Sections 79 and 85 making them liable for  any offence \nattributable to a computer belonging to the Bank.

Many DoS attacks, such as the Ping of  Death \nand Teardrop attacks, exploit limitations in the TCP/IP protocols.140 \nIn a typical connection, the user sends a message asking the server to  \nauthenticate it. The server returns the authentication approval to the user.  The \nuser acknowledges this approval and then is allow ed onto the server.

When it \ndoes close the connection, the attacker sends a new  batch of forged requests, \nand the process begins again tying up the service  indefinitely.141 \nAttacks can be directed at any network device, including attacks on  \nrouting devices and Web, electronic mail, or Domain Name System servers.  A \nDoS attack can be perpetrated in a number of ways. There are three  basic \ntypes of attack:  \n1.  Consumption  of computational resources  such a s bandwidth, disk  \nspace or CPU Time;  \n2. Disruption of configuration information , such as routing \ninformation;  \n3. Disruption of physical network components.  \nDistributed denial of service attack (DDoS) occurs when multiple  \ncompromised systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted  system, \nusually one or more web servers. These systems are compromised  by attacke rs \nusing a variety of methods. Malware can carry DDoS attack  mechanisms; one \nof the more well known example s of this was MyDoom. Its  DoS m echanism \nwas triggered on a specific date and time. A system  may also be compromised \nwith a Trojan , allowing the attacker to download  a zombie agent.  Attackers \ncan also break into systems using automated  tools that exploit flaws in \nprograms that listen for  connections from remote  hosts.  This scenario \nprimarily concerns systems acting as servers on the  web. It is important to note \nthe difference between a DDoS and DoS attack.  If an attacker mounts a smurf \nattack from a single host it would be classified  as a DoS attack. In fact, any \nattack against availability would be classed as  a Denial of Service attack. On \nthe other hand, if an attacker uses,  a thousand  zombie systems to \n                                                           \n141 Manthan M Desai, \u201cHacking For Be ginners: a beginners guide to learn ethical hacking\u201d  \nalso at http://www.cnet.com/news/how -a-denial -of-service -attack -works/  (Retrieved on 18th \nFebruary, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 99 \n \nsimultaneously launch smurf attacks against a remote  host, this would be \nclassified a s a DDoS attack.142 \nThe major advantages to an attacker of using a distributed denial -of- \nservice attack are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic  than \none machine, multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than  one attack \nmachine, and that the behavior of each attack machine can be  stealthier, \nmaking it hard er to track down and shut down.143 \nTrinoo  was the first well known D istributed denial of Service attack \nused against the University of Minnesota in August 1999. This two day attack  \ninvolved flooding servers with UDP packets originating from thousands of \nmachines. Source addresses were not spoofed, so systems running the \noffending daemons were contacted. However, the attacker responded simply \nby introducing new daemon machines into t he attack. Trinoo was first found \nas a binary daemon on a number of compromised Solaris 2.x systems. \nMalicious code had been introduced through exploitation of buffer over -run \nbugs in the remote procedure call (RPC) services .144 \n 6.9 Data  Theft  \nThe biggest case of data breach/data theft/identity theft  was exposed in \nJanuary, 2009, in which Albert Gonzalez, a 28 -year-old American along  with \nhis two Russian accomplices,  were arrested for masterminding a global \nscheme to steal  data of more than 130 million cred it and debit cards by  \nhackin g into the computer systems of fi ve major companies  including \nHannaford Bros Supermarkets, 7 -Eleven and  Heartland Payment Systems, a \ncredit card processing  company.145 Gonzalez has been said to be one of the \nnation \u2019s (U.S.) cyber -crime kingpins, by prosecutors.

Business \nsecrets, technical knowhow, designs, music,  films, books, personal data \nincluding usernames, credit  card numbers and passwords, are some forms of \nproperty  that drive the informa tion economy. Money, time, effort and  \ncreativity go into the creation and compilation of data and  information. \nStealing of data and information through  hacking and other means, is the most \nprevalent cyber crime.146 \nData is like a chameleon that plays comedy with our  traditional law \nrelating to theft. Theft is a crime that has  existed in  our law since time \nimmemorial. Section 378 of the  Indian Penal Code defines \u2018theft\u2019 in the \nfollowing words: - \n\u201c378. T heft. - Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any  moveable  \nproperty out of the possession of any person without  that person \u2019s consent, \nmoves that property in order to such  taking, is said to commit theft.\u201d  \nAs per the aforesaid defi nition, there can be theft in law  of only \nmoveable property, which is required to b e moved. The  term \u2018moveable \nproperty \u2019 is intended to include corporeal  property of every description except \nland and things  attached to the earth or permanently fastened to anything  \nwhich is attached to the earth.147 Theft has been held to be  an offence that  \napplies only to tangibles.  Electricity, for instance, has been held as not covered  \nwithin the ambit of \u2018moveable property \u2019. The Supreme  Court in Avtar Singh v. \nState of Punjab148 held that stealing  of electricity is theft because of section 39 \nof the Electr icity Act, not section 378 I.P.C. The Court said:  \n                                                           \n146 Vivek Sood, Cyber Crimes, Electronic Evidence & Investigation \u2013 Legal Issues 137 -139 \n(NABHI Publications, New Delhi, 2010)  also at \nhttp://thegiga.in/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=KX1_Imk_gDs%3D&tabid=589  (Accessed on 01 \nMarch, 2016)  \n147 Indian Penal Code, 1860., s. 22  \n148 AIR l965 SC 666  \nP a g e  | 101 \n \n\u201cWith regard to the \ufb01rst reason that Section 39 of the Act  extended the \noperation of Section 378 of the Code, it seems to us  beyond question that \nSection 39 did not extend Section 37 8 in the  sense of amend ing it or in any \nway altering the language used in it.  Section 378, read by itself even after the \nenactment of section 39,  would not include a theft of electricity for electricity \nis not  considered to be moveable property. The only way in which it can  be \nsaid that Section 39 extended Section 378 is by stating that it  made something \nwhich was not a theft under Section 378, a  theft: within the meaning of that \nsection. It follows that if Section 39 did  so, it created the offence itself and \nSection 378 did not do so. In this  view of the matter we do not think it possible \nto say that the thing  so made a  theft and an offence, became one by  virtue of \nSection 378\u201d.  \nApplying the law of theft to information and data is a  comedy of sorts. \nWhen information and data are  encapsulated in a tangible form, for instance, \nstored in a  \ufb02oppy, CD, or pen -drive, they are part of moveable property  and \nhence can be said to be stolen if the medium (\ufb02oppy, CD,  or pen -drive) is \nmoved without the consent of the person in  possession. Also , if the computer \nitself is stolen, since data  and information are a part thereof, they too can be \nsaid to be  stolen. However, in the online environment, where data and  \ninformation are intangible i.e. mere combinations of binary  numbers , the legal \ndefiniti on of \u2018theft\u2019 falls  short. Stealing of data and informat ion online is no \n\u2018theft\u2019 in the eyes of section 378 I.P.C.  \nIn this sense, the expression  \u2018data theft \u2019 is a misnomer from the legal \nperspective. It is an  expression of common parlance. For instance, if an \nemployee  dishonestly and without the consent of his employer sends/transmits \ncritical data through e -mail to an e -mail account  belonging to him or another, \nit would not amount to theft  under the I.P.C. However, if he were to store the \ndata in a CD  and take it away, it would amount to theft.  \nData/information theft can be said to be committed in six ways, in \nother  words, it has the following species:  \nP a g e  | 102 \n \n\uf0b7 The \ufb01rst unauthorized copying of data / information\u037e  \n\uf0b7 Making unauthorized subsequent copies;  \n\uf0b7 Making a cop y and dishonestly sending the data /information online;  \n\uf0b7 Unauthorized copying of data / information in a \ufb02oppy,  C.D. or pen -\ndrive and dishonestly taking it away;  \n\uf0b7 Stealing the computer itself;  \n\uf0b7 Data / Information already reside  in a movabl e storage medium \n(\ufb02oppy, C.D. or pen -drive) that is  dishonestly taken away.  \nApplying the defi nition of theft in the Indian Penal  Code, 1860 to the \nabove species, only the latter three  constitute the offence of \u2018theft\u2019 under \nsection 378.  \nSimilarly, for the offence of dishon est misappropriation  of property \nalso (as de fined in section 403 IPC), the property  must be moveab le i.e. \ntangible. As per the defi nition,  whoever dishonestly misappropriates or \nconverts to his  own use any moveable property, shall be punished with  \nimprison ment upto two years.  \nThe I.T. (Amendment) Act, 2008 however brings into  existence the \noffence of \u2018data theft \u2019 (even though not  encapsulated in a medium such as CD, \ncomputer pen -drive  or \ufb02oppy). The following clauses of section 43 read with \nthe new version of section 66 that makes the said clause a penal  offenc e, \nincorporates the offence of \u2018data theft \u2019 in the true  sense of the expression from \nthe legal perspective:  \n\u201c43. If any person without permission of the owner or any other \nperson who is incharge of a computer, computer system or computer network,  \n(b) Downloads , copies or extracts any data, computer data base or \ninformation from such computer, computer system or  computer including \ninformation or data held or stored in any removable storage medium.  \n(c) Steal , conceals, destroys or alters or causes any person to steal, \nconceal, destroy or alter any computer source code used for a computer \nresource with an intention  to cause damage.\u201d  \nP a g e  | 103 \n \nAnother form of data breach is breach of trust with  respect to data and \ninformation. The I.T. industry primarily  deals with data and information in \nsome form or the other.  A call center uses data to answer queries of customers \nof banks, telecom service providers etc. A software company  develops \nsoftware using data and information. A web -site compiles information and \npresents it online.  \nData and  information drive the I.T. industry. They are the inputs,  raw \nmaterial and outputs for the I.T. industry.  Data and information may be \nentrusted to employees of  the organization, its business associates, service \nproviders,  agents and other parties for specifi c purposes. Incidents of  breach of \ndata and information, by such trusted parties  frequent ly confront the I.T. \nindustry. Misappropriation of  data / information by a person who holds it in \ntrust would  amount to criminal breach of trust under the Indian Penal  Code.  \nIn 2010, the two cases of data theft have come to light, first is \nTravelocity.co.i n v. ClearTrip.com  and second is JustDial v. Infomedia . In the \nfirst case Travelocity has filed an FIR with Gurgaon Police against CEO, \nCleartrip  and former MD of  Desiya  alleging criminal breach of trust, data \ntheft, cheating, criminal misappropriation and criminal conspiracy. It was \nalleged that MD Desiya has pass on the company \u2019s intellectual property, trade \nsecrets, sensitive data, proprietary technology source codes, t heir entire hotel \nbusiness model and projections to the CEO of Cleartrip. In the second case it \nis reported that JustDial has obtained injunction against Infomedia 18 Limited \nfor running website www.askme.in, as it was alleged that Infomedia 18 \nLimited had  copied JustDial database onto its newly launched website: \nwww.askme.in, thereby violating JustDial \u2019s database copyrights. The \ninjunction was granted exparte by the Hon \u2019ble High Court and further order \nhas been made for search and seizure to be carried out  at Infomedia \u2019s Delhi \nP a g e  | 104 \n \nand Mumbai offices, as prima -facie case was made out by the Just Dial \nofficials.149 \n 6.10 Data  Diddling  \nData diddling involves changing data prior or during input into a \ncomputer. In other words, information is changed from the way it should be \nentered by a person typing in the data, a virus that changes data, the \nprogrammer of the database or application, or anyone else involved in the \nprocess of having information stored in a computer file. The culprit can be \nanyone involved in the pr ocess of creating; recording, encoding, examining, \nchecking, converting, or transmitting data. This is one of the simplest methods \nof committing a computer -related crime, because it requires almost no \ncomputer skills whatsoever. Despite the ease of committ ing the crime, the cost \ncan be considerable.150 \nElectricity companies are the one who mostly suffer due to this kind of \ncrime in India.  The NDMC Electricity Billing Fraud Case that took place in \n1996 is a typical example. The computer network was used for re ceipt and \naccounting of electricity bills by the NDMC, Delhi. Collection of money, \ncomputerized accounting, record maintenance and remittance in the bank were \nexclusively left to a private contractor who was a computer professional. He \nmisappropriated huge  amount of funds by manipulating data files to show less \nreceipt and bank remittance.151 \n 6.11 Salami Attacks  \n A salami attack is a series of minor data security attack  that that \ntogether result  in a larger attack. For example, a fraud  activity in a bank,  \nwhere an  employee steals a small amount of funds from several accounts,  can \nhe considered a salami attack.  Crimes involving salami attacks typically are  \n                                                           \n149 http://www.cyberlawtimes.com/indian -web-portal -wars -travelocity -cleatrip -justdial -\ninfomedia -askme -data-theft/(Retrieved on 18th February, 2016)  \n150 http://www.niagarapolice.ca/en/community/co mputercrimeprevention.asp (Retrieved on \n18th February, 2016)  \n151 http://indiaforensic.com/compcrime1.htm (Retrieved on 18th February, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 105 \n \ndifficult to detect and trace. These attacks are used for the commission of \nfinancial  crimes. The key here is to make the alteration so insignificant  that in \na single case it would go completely unnoticed.  A bank  employee inserts a \nprogram, into the bank \u2019s servers, that deducts  a small  amount of money (say \nRs. 5 a month) from the account of every customer.  No account holder will \nprobably notice this unauthorized debit, but the  bank employee will make a \nsizab le amount of money every month.152  \n To cite  an example, an employee of a bank in USA was dismissed \nfrom  his job. Disgruntled at having been supposedly mistreated by his \nemployers  the man first introduced a logic bomb into the bank \u2019s systems. The \nlogic bomb was programmed to take ten cents from  all the accounts in the \nbank and put them into the account of the person  whose name was \nalphabetically the last name of Ziegler. The amount being withdrawn from \neach of the accounts in the bank was so insignificant that neither the account \nholders nor the bank official noticed the fault. It was brought to their notice \nwhen a person by the nam e of Ziegler opened his account in that bank. He was \nsurprised to find a sizable amount of money being transferred into his account \nevery Saturday.153 \n 6.12 E-mail Bombing  \nIn inter net usage, an e -mail bomb is a form of net abuse consisting of  \nsending huge volumes of e -mail to a n address in an attempt to overfl ow the \nmailbox or overwhelms the server.  Mail  bombing is the act of sending  an e-\nmail bomb, a term shared with the act of sending actual exploding  devices. \nMail bombing is sometimes accomplished by  giving the victim \u2019s e-mail \naddress to multiple spammers.

In  one \ncase,  a foreigner who had been residing in S himla, India for almost  thirty \nyears wanted to avail of a scheme introduced by the Shimla Housing Board  to \nbuy land at lower rates. When he made an application it was  rejected on the \ngrounds that the scheme was available only for citizens of  India. He decided to \ntake his revenge.  Consequently he sent thousands of  mails to the Shimla \nHousing Board and repeatedly kept sending e -mails till  their servers crashed. \nE-mail bombing is characterized by abusers  repeatedly sending an e -mail \nmessage to a particular address at a specific  victim site. In many instances, the \nmessages will be large and constructed  from meaningless data in an effort to \nconsume additional system and  network resources. Multiple accounts at the \ntarget site may be abused,  increasin g the denial of service impact.155 \nE-mail spamming is a variant of bombing; it refers to sending e -mail to  \nhundreds or thousands of users. E -mail spamming can be made worse if  \nrecipients reply to the e -mail, causing all the original addressees to receive  the \nreply. It may also occur innocently, as a result of sending a message to  mailing \nlists and not realizing that the list explodes to thousands of users.156 \n 6.13 E-mail Spoofing  \nE-mail spoofing is a term used to describe fraudulent e -mail activity in  \nwhich the sender address and other parts of the e -mail header are  altered  to \nappear as though the e -mail originated from a different source.

By changing certain properties of  the e-mail, \nsuch as the From, Return -Path and Reply -To fields (which can  be found in the \nmessage header), ill -intentioned users can make the e -mail appear to be from \nsomeone other than the actual sender. It is often  associated with website \nspoofing which mimic an ac tual, well -known  website but are run by another \nparty either with fraudulent intentions or as  a means of criticism of the \norganisation \u2019s activities.\u201d157 \nIt is the forgery of an e -mail header so that the message appears to \nhave  originated from someone or somewhere other than the actual source.  \nDistributors of spam often use spoofing in an attempt to get recipients to  open, \nand possibly even respond to, their solicitations. Spoofing can be  used \nlegitimately. Classic examples of senders who might prefer to d isguise  the \nsource of the e -mail include a sender reporting mistreatment by a spouse  to a \nwelfare agency or a \u201cwhistle -blower\u201d who fears retaliation. However,  \nspoofing anyone other than you is illegal in some jurisdictions.158  \nE-mail spoofing is possible be cause Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  \n(SMTP), the main protocol used in sending e -mail, does not include an  \nauthentication mechanism. Although an SMTP service extension allows  an \nSMTP client to negotiate a security level with a mail server, this  precaution i s \nnot often taken. If the precaution is not taken, anyone with  the requisite \nknowledge can connect to the server and use it to send  messages. To send \nspoofed e -mail, senders insert commands in headers  that will alter message \ninformation. It is possible to send a message that  appears to be from anyone, \nanywhere, saying whatever the sender wants  it to say.

Delhi police arrested the \naccused for theft of Internet time.  \n On further inquiry in the case, it was found that Krishan Ku mar, son of \nan ex army officer, working as senior executive in M/s Highpoint Tours & \nTravels had used Col Bajwa \u2019s login and passwords as many as 207 times from \nhis residence and twice from his office. He confessed that Shashi Nagpal, from \nwhom he had purch ased a computer, gave the login and password to him. The \npolice could not believe that time could be stolen. They were not aware of the \nconcept of time -theft at all. Colonel Bajwa \u2019s report was rejected. He decided \nto approach The Times of India, New Delhi.  They, in turn carried a report \nabout the inadequacy of the New Delhi Police in handling cyber crimes. The \nCommissioner of Police, Delhi then took the case into his own hands and the \npolice under his directions raided and arrested Krishan Kumar under secti ons \n379, 411, 34 of IPC and section 25 of the Indian Telegraph Act. In another \ncase, the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police arrested a computer \nengineer who got hold of the password of an Internet user, accessed the \ncomputer and stole 107 hours of Inte rnet time from the other person \u2019s account. \nHe was booked for the crime by a Delhi court during May 2000.166 \n 6.16 Cyber  Crime  related  to Intellectual  Property  Rights  \n6.16.1 Domain Name violations and passing off  \nA domain name identifies a computer or a sub  Network of computers \nin the Internet. In simple terms, a domain name is a name -cum-address on the \nInternet, of any person or entity. A computer or device that is  attached to the \nInternet has an address popularly known as Domain name. With the  \nadvancement o f internet communication and growing e -commerce and its \nfuture  potential, domain names today are serving as trade names or brands and \ncarry with  them the goodwill and reputation of the websites they represent. \nDomain names  being used as business identifier s have attained importance and \nlegal sanctity as a  means of differentiation between e -players since e -\n                                                           \n166 http://indiaforensic.com/compcrime1.htm (Retrieved on 18th Fe bruary, 2016)  \nP a g e  | 111 \n \ncommerce is conducted in the  absence of personal interaction or the \nopportunity to inspect the goods.  \nIn Cardservice International Inc. v. Mc Gee167, it was  held that the \ndomain name serve  same function as the trademark and is not a mere address \nor like finding number on  the Internet and, therefore, it is entitled to equal \nprotection as trademark. It was  further held that a domain name is more than a \nmere Int ernet address for it also  identifies the Internet site to those who reach \nit, much like a person \u2019s name identifies  a particular person.  \nThe word \u2018domain \u2019 as per Chambers 21st Century Dictionary means a \nterritory  owned or ruled by one person or Government . \nWebster \u2019s defines it in different contexts  as under: \u2014 \n\uf0b7 A field of action, thought, influence;  \n\uf0b7 Territory governed by a single rule or Government;  \n\uf0b7 Region characterised by a specific features;  \n\uf0b7 Law;  \n\uf0b7 Land to which their superior title and absolute ownership.  \nThus, in common parlance any title or name or mark or brand or \nidentity in any  field of activity or a trade name over which a particular \nindividual has the exclusive,  prior and lone claim is the domain name or trade \nname for any kind of activity. Trade  mark is at par with a territory and the \nowner of any trade mark is placed in the same  position as owner of \nterritory .168Domain name registrations and protection of a trademark in \nrelation thereto  has been recognised by courts.  \nThe law relating to passing off is  fairly well settled. The  principle \nunderlying the action is that no man is entitled to carry on his business in  such \na way as to lead to the belief that he is carrying on the business of another man  \nor to lead to believe that he is carrying on or has any connection with the \nbusiness  carried on by another man. The principles of common law govern \n                                                           \n167 Cardservice International Inc. v. Mc Gee, 42 USPQ 2d 1850  \n168 Pfizer Products Inc. v.

As held by courts, the purpose of this tort is to protect \ncommercial goodwill to  ensure that people \u2019s business reputations are not \nexploited . It is based on economic  policy, the need to encourage enterprise and \nto ensure commercial stability.  \nThere is a difference between statute law relating to trademarks  and the \npassing  off action; for, while registration of relevant mark itself gives title to \nthe registered  owner, the onus in a passing off action lies upon the plaintiff to \nestablish the existence  of the business reputation which he seeks to protect. \nThe asset protected is the  reputation the plaintiffs business has to the relevant \nmark. It is  not always necessary  that there must be in existence goods of that \nother man with which the defendant  seeks to confuse his own. Passing off may \noccur in cases where the plaintiffs do not  in fact deal with the offending \ngoods.  \nWith the advancement and prog ress in technology, services rendered in \nthe Internet has also come to be recognised and accepted and are being given \nprotection  so as to protect such provider of service from passing off the \nservices rendered by  others. In an Internet service, a particula r Internet site \ncould be reached by anyone  anywhere in the world who proposes to visit the \nsaid Internet site. As a matter of fact  in a matter where services rendered \nthrough the domain name in the Internet, a very  alert vigil is necessary and a \nstrict vie w is to be taken for its easy access and reach by  anyone from any \ncorner of the globe. It is also observed that considering the vastness  of the \nIntern et and its relatively recent availability to the general public, many \nInternet users are not sophisticated  enough to distinguish between the subtle \ndifference in the  domain names of the parties.  \nThe degree of the similarity of the marks usually is vitally important \nand significant in an action for passing off.  \nThe two ma rks/ domain names \u2018Yahoo \u2019, and \u2018Yahooindia \u2019 are almost \nsimilar  except for use of the suffix \u2018India \u2019 in the latter. There is every \npossibility of an Intern et user being confused and deceived in believing that \nP a g e  | 113 \n \nboth the domain names belong to  one common source and connection, \nalthough the t wo belong to two different concerns.  As held by the Supreme \nCourt, the word \u2018India \u2019 added to one mark is of no consequence.  Thus there is \nevery possibility of the Internet users to believe that \u2018Yahooindia \u2019 is another \nname in the series of Yahoo marks/ nam es and thereby there is every  \npossibility of confusion being created and thereby preventing these users from \nreaching  the Internet site of plaintiff, \u2018Yahoo.com \u2019.169 \nIn another case, the defendants were found  manufacturing, selling or \noffering for sale the products like Supari and Chewing  Toba cco under the \ntrademark \u2018Yahoo \u2019.170 \nUnder the trademark INFOSYS, the plaintiff company was \nincorporated in the  year 1981 and has earned a very high degree of goodwill \nhaving acquired the status  of one of the leading expor ters of computer \nsoftware. Defendants use of trade mark/ name INFOSYS, also engaged in \ncomputer business, amounts to infringement of the plaintiffs registered trade \nmark numbers. Defendants hosted a website www.blitzerinfosys.com  and \nmark INFOSYS was poste d on such website prominently.171 \nPen Books Pvt. Ltd. got registered  the domain name \u2018penb ooks.com \u2019 \nin 1999 but,  due to some technical snags could not launch the website. The \nvalidity period of  registration of t he said name expired on 2 -3-2001. When  the \nplaintiff sought to launch  the website again in 2002, it found that the domain \nname \u2018penbooks.com \u2019 stood  registered in the name of defendant and it was \nadvertised on the Internet for sale. The  Court found such a registration in the \nname of the defenda nt to be an abusive  registration of domain name in \nviolation of the rights of trademarks and service  marks. Considering the \nUniform Domain Name Disputes Resolution Policy, the Court  found that the \ndomain name having been registered by the defendant for the  purpose  of \n                                                           \n169 Yahoo!

Its application for registration of the trade mark in India is pending. \nThe plaintiff  having spent a lot of time, money and effort in developing the \nproduct and the trade  mark VIAGRA as its registered owner does have a \nlegitimate interest in protecting its  brand. Defendant does not have a ny interest \nin the domain name \u2018viagra.i n\u2019 apart  from putting it up for sale.  In any event, \nthe domain name \u2018viagra.in \u2019 is, if not identical,  confusingly similar to the trade \nmark VIAGRA and the domain name \u2018viagra.com \u2019 of which plaintiff is t he \nproprietor. The domain name \u2018viagra.in \u2019 is inactive. The Court  held that the \nconduct of th e defendant, is nothing but of \u2018cyber squatting \u2019. Squatting  on an \naddress in cyber space over which the rights and interests of the plaintiff far  \noutweigh those, i f at all, of the defendant .173 \n6.16.2 Softwa re Piracy   \nCopyright subsists throughout India in  the following classes of works: -  \n\uf0b7 Original literary, dramatic  and musical ; \n\uf0b7 Artistic works;  \n\uf0b7 Computer Programme;  \n\uf0b7 Cinematograph films; and  \n\uf0b7 Sound recording.  \nIn India, the Copyright Act, 1957 governs computer software. So as to \nkeep pace  with the advancement of science and technology especially in the \nfield of  communication and data processing, Parliament has amended the \nCopyright Act,  1957 in year 1995. \u2018Computer Programme \u2019 within the meaning \nof Section 2(ffc ) of the  Copyright Act is included in the definition of a literary \nwork as per section 2(o ) of the  said Act. The definition of \u2018literary works \u2019 \nspecifically includes computer programmes,  tables and compilations including \n                                                           \n172 Pen Books Pvt.

The term \u2018comput er progra mme \u2019 as defined by Section \n2(ffc ) of the Copyright Act, means a set of instructions  expressed in words, \ncodes, schemes or in any other form including a machine readable  medium, \ncapable of causing a computer to perform a particular task or result. Computer  \nprograms are the product of an intellectual process. It may be copyrightable as  \nintellectual property. There fore, reading section 2(i), 2(ffc ) and Section 13 and \n14 of  the Copyright Act, it becomes clear that a computer programme is by \nvery defini tion original literary work, therefore law protects such copy right. \nSome common methods  of copyright infringement in relation to computer \nsoftware as stated are: \u2014 \n\uf0b7 Reproducing the original owner \u2019s software and packaging of that  \nsoftware, so that purchasers  are deliberately misled into believing that  the \nproduct they are buying is genuine software.  \n\uf0b7 Reproducing or \u2018burning \u2019 the original owner \u2019s software onto a blank  \nCD, where no attempt is made to represent that the copy is genuine.  \n\uf0b7 Reproducing a number of th e owner \u2019s programme on a single CD - \nROM, known as a \u2018compilation \u2019 CD.174 \nAnother form of piracy that is assuming alarming shape in the \ninformation  technology age is that of internet piracy when software is \ndownloaded from the  Internet or distributed via inte rnet without the \npermission of the copyright owner.  \nDue to fast expanding consumer base of computer products, it is a \ncommon  knowledge that there is voluminous counterfeit and piracy of \nhardware and software  of leading companies. Under Section 63 of the \nCopyright Act, any infringement of the  copyright in a computer programme / \nsource code is punishable. Therefore, prima  facie, if a person alters computer \nprogramme of another person or another computer  company, the same would \nbe infringement of the copyrig ht.

Further \ncompression technology has also played very important role in transferring \ndata at fast speed and in less time.  \nIn A& M Records Inc. v. Napster Inc.,  176 also known as Napster \u2019s case \nis considered to be the landmark first case where legality of digital music \nsharing over the internet was questioned. Napster, on the internet had changed \nthe way people listen to music. People could download free softwar e from \ndefendant \u2019s website and this software lets them share music i n the form of \nMP3 files. Basically Na pster developed a software called Napster \u2019s Music  \nShare Software, which is ava ilable free of charge from Napster \u2019s Internet site, \nand Napster \u2019s network server . It facilitated the transmission of MP3 files \nbetween and am ong its users, through peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, Napster \nallowed its users to:  \n(1) Store  MP3 music files on individual computer hard drives available \nfor copyright by other Na pster users;  \n(2) search for MP3 music files stor ed on other users \u2019 computers;  \n(3) Transfer  exact copies of the contents of other u sers\u2019 MP3 files from \none computer to another via the Internet.  \n                                                           \n176 114 F. Supp 2d 896 (N.D. Cal 2000)  \nP a g e  | 118 \n \nNapster became the rage among music fans particularly in Colleges  \nand universities around USA. The use of Napster \u2019s site was so high that \nseveral colleges had to ban it from their networks not because it was illegal but \nbecause its heavy usage was taking up enormous amounts of bandwidth. For \nthe young company there could hardly be any better news.  \nThere was just one little problem.  Recording companies that produce  \nthe music in the first place have copyrights on them and what Napster started \ndoing was questionable and illegal. It is not that Napster was unaware of the \npossible legal problem but it was hoping its new technology would let it \nsurvive in the courtroom by using a \"fair use\" defense against copyright \ninfringement charges since nobody sold the music to anyone else but merely \ndistributed it for free. Therefore, Napster was hoping to strike a deal with the \nrecording compan ies and actually work with them rather than fight with them.  \nHowever this did not happen. The Recording Industry Associat ion of \nAmerica (RIM) sued Napster for copyright violation . A complaint was  filed \nagainst Napster for injunction as he was a contributor y and vicarious copyright \ninfringer.  \nNapster raised \u2018fair use \u2019 defense which includes uses for such purp oses \nas criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple cop ies for \nclassroom), scholarship, or research. It is important to note that i f a use is fair \nthen it is not an infringement of copyr ight. It identified three specifi c uses in \npractice : \n1. Sampling, where users make temporary copies of a work before \npurchasing;  \n2. space -shifting, where users access a sound recording through the \nNaps ter system that they already own in audio CD format; and  \n3. Permissive distribution of recordings by both new and established \nartistes.  \nThe Court applied the following factors  to decide whether fair doctrine \ncan b e applied:   \nP a g e  | 119 \n \n1. The purpose and character of the use;   \n2. The nature of copyrighted work;   \n3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the \nwork as a whole; and   \n4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for the work or the \nvalue  of the work.   \nThe court held that Napster users are not fair users because:  \n1. Downloading MP3 files does not transform the copyrighted work;  \n2. Copyrighted musical compositions and sound recordings are \ncreative in  nature and thus need copyright protection;  \n3. Users en gage in wholesale copying of copyrighted work because \n\ufb01les transfer necessarily involves copying the entirety of the copyrighted  \nwork;  \n4. Harms the market in at least two ways: it reduces audio CD sales \namong  college students and it raises barriers to plaintiff \u2019s entry into the market  \nfor the digital downloading of music.  \nOn July 26, 2000, the District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia  granted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction, thus prevented \ndefendant Napster  from  engaging in, or facilita ting, or distributing plaintiff\u2019s  \ncopyrighted musical  compositions and sound recordings, without express \npermission of the right  owners.  \nThe Court held that a majority of Napster users use the service to \ndownload  and upload copyrighted music and by doing t hat, it constitutes direct  \ninfringement  of plaintiff \u2019s musical compositions, recordings. Regarding  \ncontributing copyright infringement, the Court held that:  the record clearly \nshows that Napster had actually knowledge that  specific infringing material \nwas available using its system.  That it could block access to the infringing \nmaterial and but it failed to  remove the material.  \nTherefore, it is liable for copyright infringement. Further the District \nCourt,  by an order, imposed an obligation:  on the record co mpany to notify \nP a g e  | 120 \n \nNapster of specific infringing files; and  on Napster to constantly search its \nindex and block all such particular  files.  \nThe record companies appealed but this order was upheld and it was  \nreaffirmed that the plaintiffs were supposed to provide notice to Napster of its  \ncopyrighted music files before Napster was to prevent access to such  \nobjectionable content. That means that Napster still has to remove copyrighted  \nmaterial whenever it was made aware of its presence on its network. As \nNaps ter was unable to do this therefore, it was left with no option but to shut \ndown its  service in July 2001.  \n6.16.4 Rights of reproduction and Database  \nA data base is a collection of data in cyberspace, which is organized so \nthat its contents can easily be accessed, managed and updated. It is important \nto note that reproduction rights are equally  affec ted if a copyright material of \nthe author is reproduced in an electronic form  without  his consent and made \npart of a database.  In New Yo rk Times Co. v. Tasin ,177 there was an agreement \nbetween six freelance authors and publishers  whereby  the articles of authors \nwere to be published in three print periodicals.  However, without the \nfreelancers consent, two computer database companies  placed co pies of the \nfreelancers \u2019 articles, along with all  other  articles from the periodicals in which \nthe freelancers \u2019 work appeared, into  three databases.  The freelance authors \u2019 \ncomplaint alleged that their copyrights had been  infringed  by the inclusion of \ntheir articles in the databases. The publishers, in  response , relied on the \nprivilege of reproduction and distribution accorded them  by Section 20l(c) of \nDigital Millennium Copyright Act, l998.  \nThe US Supreme Court held that the Electronic Publishers infringed \nthe author \u2019s copyrights by reproducing and distributing the articles in a \nmanner not  authorized  by the authors and not privileged by Section 20l(c). It \nwas further  held that even the Print Publishers infringed the authors \u2019 \n                                                           \n177 533 U.S. 483(2001)  \nP a g e  | 121 \n \ncopyrights by  authorizing  the Electronic Publishers to place the articles in the \nDatabases and by  aiding  the Electronic Publishers in that endeavour.  \nIn Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp .,178 the plaintiff, Leslie Kelly, a \nprofessional  photographer  had copyrighted many of his images of the \nAmerican West. Some  of these images were located on Kelly \u2019s website or \nother websites with which  Kelly  had license agreement. The defendant, Arriba \nSoft Corp oration  operated an  internet search engine that displayed its results in \nthe form of small pictures  rather than the more usual form of text. Arriba \nmaintained its database of pictures  by copying images from other websites \nincluding plaintiff \u2019s website. By clicking  on one of these small pictures, called \nthumbnails, the user could view a large  version  of that same picture within the \ncontext of the Arriba web page.  \nSubsequently plaintiff, Kelly discovered that his photographs were part \nof Arriba \u2019s search engine database, he filed a suit for copyright infringement. \nThe District Court found that plaintiff;  Kelly had established a prima facie \ncase of  copy right infringement based on Arriba \u2019s unauthorized reproduction \nand display  of Kelly \u2019s works, but that this reproduction and display constituted \na non -infringing  fair use under Section 107 of the D igital Mill ennium \nCopyright Act 1 998. \nKelly fi led an appeal in the Circuit Court which held that \u201cthe creation \nand the use of the thumbnails in the search engine is a fair use, but the display \nof the  larger  image is a violation of Kelly \u2019s exclusive right to publicly display \nhis works. This use of Kelly \u2019s image doesn \u2019t amount to copying them but, \nrather, importing them directly from Kelly \u2019s website. Therefor it cannot be \ncopyright infringement based on reproduction of copyrighted work s.

But the history tells us that most of the \ntime anything invented, it was used for the good cause and the bad  cause that \nis for constructive as well as destructive purposes. We can take a lot of \nexample to understand this such as \u2018Nuclear Energy \u2019, when it was discovered \nit was not known to the scientists that its most large -scale use in the future will \nnot be as an alternative source of energy for the benefit of mankind but in \nmaking nuclear bombs which will put question mark even on the very \nexistence of humans, we can also take example of Internet, which was \ndeveloped to facilitate the communication across the w orld, but we can see \nthat it is now almost equally for beneficial activities and harmful once such as \nfrauds, pornography, theft, hacking, harassment etc. This is the same case with \nWireless Technology and The Mobile Phone system, which were also been \nmisu sed a lot in illegal and destructive activities.180  \n                                                           \n179 Ling Rich, The Mobile Connection: The Cell phone\u2019s impact on society,  2004  \n180 Prof. R.K.Chaubey, \u201cAn Introduction to Cyber Crime and Cyber law\u201d, Kamal Law House, \n2012.  p. 569  \nP a g e  | 123 \n \n Mobile telephones ore at the centre of a rapidly growing crime \nwave,  the stolen mobile even used as a criminal \u2018Currency \u2019. At the same time, \nthe technological complexity of a phone fraud makes detection and \nprosecution difficult. Thus we need new law to deal with the crime related to \nmobile phone and problems arising therefrom.  \n6.17.2 Phreaking  \nPhreaking is a slang term coined to describe the activity of a subculture \nof people who study, experiment with,  or exploit telephones, for the purposes  \nof hobby or utility. The term \u2018phreak \u2019 may also refer to the use of various \naudio frequencies to manipulate a phone syste m. It is often considered similar, \nand therefore grouped in category with computer hacking.  This is sometimes \ncalled the H/P culture (H for Hacking and P for Phreaking.) Most  phreakers \nrange from the ages of 12 -17. Most stop after this because puni shments can \nbecome more severe once the pe rpetrator is no longer a minor. 181 \nMany Phreaking  techniques can be implemented with small electronic \ncircuits, easily made by hobbyists once the secret of their operation is known. \nThe first circuit to generate the switching tones needed to reroute long -\ndistance calls was nicknamed the blue box by an ea rly phreak who had built \none in a blue enclosure.  Soon, other types of Phreaking  circuits were given \nsimilar names. Dozens of other type of \u2018boxes \u2019 were invented. Modern \nPhreaking  often involve s taking advantage of companies  Private Branch \nExchange systems , especially those which are accessible via toll -free numbers, \nto make phone calls. Phreakers do not always do illegal things. In fact, they \nmay be thought of as a hacker in the computing world Phreakers may just be \ninterested in the telecommunication worl d, about the more unknown side of \ntelephones.182  \n6.17.3 Mobile Phone Theft  \n                                                           \n181 http://academickids.com/encyclopedia/index.php/Phreaking (Accessed on 17th Fe bruary, \n2016)  \n182 Ibid \nP a g e  | 124 \n \nIncreased pressure of competition in mobile telephony sector has led to  \ncompetitive tariffs, which in turn have spurred telecom growth and  increased \nteledensity. The cost of the hand set is probably the main inhibiting  factor at \nthe low end of the market. Though this cost has also been falling  steadily, \nthere still is a gap between the prices in the grey market (consisting  of \nstolen/smuggled handsets) and the legitimate market. In order to curtail  the \nillegal grey market and protect consumer interest, some action is required  to \nbe taken to discoura ge this crime of handset theft.183 \nMobile phone instrument theft is becoming a major problem in all  \ncountries and is a key driver behind ci ty crimes and robbery. Globally this  is \nseen as a major issue and the problem is being studied to find an effective  \nsolution. In the UK, a law (Mobile Phones Reprogramming Act 2002) has  \nbeen made to curb the reprogramming of handsets. Reprogramming would  \nmake possible re -use while making it difficult to identify any theft of the  \nhandset. Other efforts are also going on, such as the establishment of a  global \nCentral Equipment Identifying Register (CEIR) at Dublin, Ireland,  and a \n\u201cMobile Industry Crime Action  Forum\u201d representing Operators,  \nManufacturers and retailers for tackling mobile phone theft and related  issues. \nIn the European Union, data is being gathered by the UK through  \nquestionnaire responses to address the matter of mobile phone theft. These  \nvario us initiatives, including responses to the questionnaire in EU, show  that a \nnumber of collaborative efforts are needed to tackle the problem of  mobile \nphone theft.184 \nEfforts need to be taken by various parties concerned, based on \nspecific  database, institut ional structures, and co -operation among \nmanufactures,  Network Operators, and among Government agencies. In fact, \nthere is a  need for even collaboration among Governments to address this \n                                                           \n183 Preliminary Consultation Paper On Mobile Phone Theft, Telecom Regulatory Authority Of \nIndia, New Delhi, January, 2004. also available online at \nhttp://trai.gov.in/WriteReaddata/ConsultationPaper/Document/mobile%20theft%20rev.1.pdf \n(Accessed on 17th Februa ry, 2016)  \n184 Ibid \nP a g e  | 125 \n \nmatter.  Based on an examination of the efforts being made internation ally, it is  \npossible to identify some of the main factors/agents that have emerged as  \nbeing important f or tackling mobile phone theft.  In summary, these  include:  \n1. Several countries do not hold mobile phone theft data. Database of \nthe relevant phones which need to be tracked is an essential ingredient of any \neffective effort to curb the theft of mobile phones. A major effort is required to \nbuild up such a database, and co -operation of all concerned would be crucial \nfor its effectiveness. In India, no a uthentic data is available regarding the \nnumber of mobile handsets stolen in a year. In those countries that have \nstatistics on mobile phone theft, data is collected by the police, and the scale of \nthe problem in some cases involves up to 330,000 stolen mo bile phones a \nyear.  \n2. There is an international market for stolen mobile phones and an \nacknowledgement that these phones are being exported. However, there is no \nhard evidence or intelligence on the import/export of stolen mobile phones. \nThere have been n o joint operations between police forces from  different \ncountries to date.  \n3. Reprogramming makes it difficult to identify the original phone, \nbecause through re -programming the identification number of the phone, i.e., \nthe International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI), is altered. \nReprogramming is undertaken by independent mobile phone retailers/repair \nshops and private individuals. However, again, there is no hard intelligence on \nthe scale and natu re of reprogramming activity.  \n4. Reprogramming  activity is illegal in a few countries and legislation \nis planned or under consideration in some others.  \n5. There has been limited joint working across Ministries to tackl e \nmobile phone theft to date.  \n6. In most countries, discussions with the mobile pho ne industry on \naddressing the problem of mobile phones have either not taken place or have \nP a g e  | 126 \n \nonly just begun and are at an early stage. Further actions to address mobile \nphone theft have t herefore not yet been agreed.  \n7. In some countries all network operato rs have joined the global \ndatabase of stolen and lost phones whilst in others no network operators are \nparticipating in the Central Equipment  Identifying Register (CEIR).  \n8. Discussions have either not taken place or are only just beginning. \nNo forward act ions have been agreed yet, either in terms of making the \nInternational Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI) tamperproof/tamper -\nresistant or in enhancing mobile phone handset security in other ways.  \nThe issue of mobile phone theft needs to be addressed  through a \nconcerted effort made globally. The more countries take action, the greater the \ncombined impact of this action. Countries need to work together \ncollaboratively to tackle this shared problem as lasting change can only be \nsecured through effective  multi -country co -operation, such as the process \ninitiated among European countries. During the period when efforts are being \nmade for such collaboration, we should begin certain efforts within our own \njurisdiction and look for various possible solutions.185 \n6.17.4 Use of mobile and wireless technology in Terrorist activities  \nAlong with other crimes one of the most dangerous applications  of the \nwireless technologies and mobile phones is their use by the terrorists in \nperforming their activities. With the help  of these latest technologies the \nterrorists were keeping  in contact with their peers more easily than in the past \nwhen communication is the biggest barrier in successful implementation of a \nplan. Now the terrorist groups around the world is well equipped with the \nlatest technology communicati on gadgets such as \u2018Satellite Phone \u2019, the \ncommunication on which is very hard to trace. Advanced mobile technology, \ncooperation between international mobile communications providers and \n                                                           \n185Preliminary Consultation Paper On Mobile Phone Theft, Telecom Regulatory Authority Of \nIndia, New Delhi, January, 2004. p. 4 -5  also available online at \nhttp://trai.gov.in/WriteReaddata/ConsultationPaper/Document/mobile%20theft%20rev.1.pdf  \n(Accessed on 17th February, 2016)   \nP a g e  | 127 \n \ninternational financial institutions, and the lack of regulations make for a \nswift, cheap, mos tly untraceable money transfer known as \"m -payments\u201d \nanywhere , anytime, by anyone with a mobile telephone. Since both terrorism \nand m -payments are global, the m -payment service provider,  as all those \nmonitoring terror financing, should have immediate real -time access to an \nintegrated, closely monitored list of all individuals, organizations, businesses, \nand countries suspected of links to terro rists.186 \nWith the use of Sim cards issued on f ake addresses the terrorist can \neasily get in contact with their masterminds and receives instructions and after \nthat they dispose off the Sim card and there will be no chance for the \ninvestigation agencies to trace their location once the card is destroye d. In an \ninterrogation of a terrorist in Kashmir after a recent arrest disclose a new fact \nthat the terrorists is now using a mobile phone as a timer device in a bomb, the \nboy tells the mechanism that they tied up the mobile phone to the bomb and \nset the m obile phone on \u2018Vibration Mode \u2019 and the bomb lied to the mobile is \nsensitive to the frequency of the vibration of the mobile, then when they want \nto detonate the bomb they used to call on the mobile tied to bomb (obviously \nthe Sim used in the phone is one which earlier be issued on false identification \nand the number of which is not known to others) and then due to the mobile \nwas in vibration mode so it not rings but vibrate, due to that vibration the \nbomb explodes. This is only an example of on what levels  the latest \ncommunication techniques can be used by the terrorists in their activities.96 \nTo understand that how efficiently these latest techniques is used by the \nterrorists we can take the example of most wanted terrorist for the USA, \nOsama Bin Laden, he  used to give messages on the internet, releases his audio \nand video tapes and gives instructions to his subordinates on his satellite \nphone, even then one of the most developed country, both in economy and \n                                                           \n186 The flip Side - Terrorists use mobile payment systems to transfer money, Available at  \nhttp://www.mgovworld.org/topstory/the -flip-side-terrorists -use-mobile -payment -systems -to-\ntransfer -money/.

However, the security features which protect the number can be \novercome and a new set of numbers installed. The change of identity is called  \n\u2018re-chipping \u2019 and can be achieved on analogue phones in a number of ways. \nSometimes, the ESN can be altered directly from the keypad using supposedly \nsecret combinations of keystrokes; in other cases, connection to a computer \ncan allow the phone chip to be re - programm ed. The software to do this is \navailable via advertisements in specialist magazines or even available free \nover the Internet. Re -chipping is not illegal and was started to bypass the \nservice providers when reconnecting a secondhand phone, replacing a fault y \none or upgrading to a new phone. Once available, however, the equipment \ncould be readily applied to give a stolen phone a new identity so it can be \nconnected to a network, and to clone another mobile phone.188 \nA clone is an analogue mobile phone which has been programmed to \nimpersonate one owned by a legitimate subscriber by using its ESN and \ntelephone number (these numbers are usually obtained by interception with a \n\u2018scanner \u2019 radio, theft of a dealer \u2019s or service provider \u2019s records or directly \nfrom the imp ersonated phone). New types are coming to the UK from t he \nUSA and Hong Kong: \u2018tumbling \u2019 phones automatically seek an identity from \n                                                           \n187 Jim Boulden, Mobiles used in high -tech terror, CNN, Apr 4, 2004  \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/04/04/mobile.terror/index.html.

Mobile phones \nhave become a major part of our e veryday life. On the one hand, India \u2019s \nmobile phone market has grown rapidly in the last decade  on the back of \nfalling phone tariffs and handset prices, making it one of the fastest growing \nmarkets globally. On the other the number of mobile phone subscrib ers is \nexceeding that of fixed -line users.190 \nToday millions of mobile phones users, be it Global System for Mobile \ncommunication (GSM) or Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), run the \nrisk of having their phones cloned. And the worst part is that there isn \u2019t much \nthat you can do to prevent this. Such crime first came to light in India in \nJanuary, 2005 when the Delhi police arrested a person with 20 cell phones, a \nlaptop, a SIM scanner, and a writer. The accused was running an exchange \nillegally where ii he c loned CDMA  based phones .  He used software for the \ncloning and provided cheap international calls to Indian immigrants in west \nAsia. A similar racket came to light in Mumbai resulting in the arrest of four \nmobile dealers. Each year, the mobile phone indust ry loses millions of dollars \nin revenue because of the criminal actions of persons who are able to \nreconfigure mobile phones so that their calls are billed to other phones owned \nby innocent third persons. Often these cloned phones are used to place \nhundred s of calls, often long distance, even to foreign countries, resulting in \nthousands of dollars in air time and long distance charges. Cellular telephone \ncompanies do not require their customers to pay for any charges illegally made \nto their account, no matt er how great the cost. But some portion of the cost of \n                                                           \n189 Duggal Pawan, Mobile Law,  Universal Law Publishing Co. Pvt.

Many criminals use cloned cellular telephones for illegal activities, \nbecause their calls are not billed to the m, and are therefore much more \ndifficult to trace. This phenomenon is especially prevalent in drug crimes. \nDrug dealers need to be in constant contact with their sources of supply and \ntheir confederates on the streets. Traffickers acquire cloned phones at a \nminimum cost, make dozens of calls, and then throw the phone away after as \nlittle \u2018as a day \u2019 use. In the same way, criminals who pose a threat to our \nnational security, such as terrorists, have been known to use cloned phones to \nthwart law enforcement efforts aimed  at tracking their whereabouts.191  \n6.17. 6 SMS spoofing  \nSMS spoofing is like e -mail spoofing, which looks to originate from \nyour acquainted number but in reality it is spoofed, and send from some evil \nminded individual. We can take this by an example. Suppose if a woman  \nreceive a Short Messaging Service (SMS) in her cellphone in the middl e of a \nnight from the mobile of her spouse asking her to bring cash as he has met \nwith an accident. The chances are that she would check the mobile number \nand if she confir ms that the cell is her husband \u2019s then she would rush out with \ncash. If this could b e the response then the chances are that she i s not aware of \n\u201cMobile Spoofing\u201d . Using web-based software, a cyber criminal could send \nanyone a message from any person \u2019s cell wit hout even touching his mobile \nand no cellular service provider can say that it was a spoofed or faked one.192  \n                                                           \n191 What is mobile phone cloning?, Laxmi Devi, India Times News Network   \n http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2005 -05-18/news/27482396_1_phone -number -\nsim-subscriber (Accessed on 18th February, 2016)  \n192 The new phony crime: SMS spoofing, PTI, Jul 11, 2004  \nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/The -new-phony -crime -SMS -\nspoofing/articleshow/773923.cms (Accessed on 18th February,  2016)  "
